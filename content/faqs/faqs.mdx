<FAQItem title="Why build a new privacy coin?">

In short, functionality and adoption.

Existing privacy coins are limited in privacy, accessibility, or both. Iron Fish integrates privacy from the ground up. We adopt the highest privacy standards based on leading-edge zero-knowledge technology.

Privacy coins have faced an uphill battle gaining adoption in the face of government regulations. They have often been outright banned or their tokens removed from exchanges. At Iron Fish, we are committed to collaborating with legislators, policy makers, and other members of the public and private sectors to develop a robust, compliant, globally usable solution.

<FAQItem title="Why focus on privacy?">

Web2 promises privacy but fails to deliver consistent and effective security guarantees. Consider digital payments systems, where payment processors and merchants aggregate vast amounts of user data that they use for targeted marketing, advertising, or monetization. Your spending habits are closely tracked on almost any online platform, often without notice or consent.

On most blockchain platforms, user addresses and transaction histories are publicly accessible, making holders of valuable assets easy targets for scammers and fraud. These factors severely limit the development of secure decentralized applications.

<FAQItem title="Why should I care about privacy?">

Privacy is pragmatic. It leads to innovation and social evolution. Much like HTTPS paved the way for entire industries through e-commerce, private transactions over a blockchain will enable frictionless global payments and new industries of borderless products and companies. We believe that privacy is part of a larger solution in which everyone has equal access to goods, services, and safe transaction channels.

Privacy also empowers you to protect yourself. You should have full control over your financial and personal data.

<FAQItem title="How do you preserve privacy?">

We build with ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs).

ZKPs are a breakthrough tool in cryptography that prove honest computation. Using ZKPs, we can build private transactions that hide the sender, recipient, and amount while confirming that the transaction is valid. Every transaction on Iron Fish is private â€” no one sees the details of an account unless the owner grants read-only permissions via view keys.

<FAQItem title="What are view keys?">

When you create an account on Iron Fish, you get view keys that you can use to give others read-only access to your transactions records. When dealing with a tax authority or other entity, you can issue view keys to grant read-only access to establish compliance, settle a dispute, etc.

<FAQItem title="What does it mean to be the privacy platform for all of crypto?">

The Iron Fish network is multi-asset capable. This means that a trusted bridge operator can integrate Iron Fish support to enable users to bring their assets from any other chain to Iron Fish and transact on our privacy-enabled network.

Multi-asset functionality also enables users to mint custom assets on the Iron Fish network with the same privacy guarantees as the native $IRON coin.

<FAQItem title="Why use Proof-of-Work (PoW)?">

We've completed thorough and extensive research on the merits and drawbacks of PoW, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPos) systems. Ultimately, PoW systems are overall more secure, have much better-understood attack vectors, and have a better path toward being fairly decentralized. PoS systems can sometimes lead to better UI/UX and faster block times, but the pros do not outweigh the cons when looking at their algorithms holistically.

<FAQItem title="What's the $IRON coin?">

The $IRON coin is the Iron Fish network cryptocurrency. It serves as a medium of exchange, the currency for transaction fees, and as a reward issued to miners on the network.

<FAQItem title="Where is the roadmap?">

Because Iron Fish is a US company, we are not able to have a public roadmap.

We are able to discuss and announce features that have defined release dates, or we're actively working on in the open source github repository.
