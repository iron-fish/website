### Purpose and Nature of the Service

Iron Fish provides a decentralized platform and protocol for private and secure blockchain transactions. The protocol consists of open-source or source-available software, including smart contracts deployed on blockchain networks. By interacting with the protocol and its associated user interface, you acknowledge the experimental nature of the technology and the inherent risks that come with its use.

Your use of the Iron Fish Website and protocol is entirely voluntary and based on your own understanding of the associated risks. It is your responsibility to review all relevant documentation, terms, and risk disclosures to ensure you fully understand the functionalities, limitations, and potential outcomes of using the protocol.

Additionally, just as email protocols (e.g., SMTP) may be accessed through various clients, the Iron Fish protocol may be accessed through multiple web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for conducting due diligence on any third-party interfaces you use and understanding the associated risks and costs.

### Risks Associated with Use

Your participation in the Iron Fish ecosystem, including but not limited to interacting with the protocol or conducting transactions via the Website, involves significant risks. These risks may include, but are not limited to:

- Loss of funds due to user error (e.g., sending tokens to incorrect addresses).
- Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts or the protocol.
- Fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets.
- Temporary or permanent unavailability of blockchain infrastructure.
- Failures caused by hardware, software, or network issues.
- Security breaches, including the introduction of malicious software or unauthorized access to your wallet.

The Company does not own or control the protocol, which operates via deployed smart contracts. By using the protocol, you accept that the Company is not responsible for any losses, damages, or disruptions resulting from your interaction with the protocol or other users.

**The Website, protocol, and all associated services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.**

### Experimental Technology

The Iron Fish protocol is an experimental project. By using it, you acknowledge and accept the risks inherent in interacting with novel blockchain technologies. These risks include, but are not limited to, potential bugs, errors, or failures in the code, as well as the possibility of permanent loss of funds.

Your use of the protocol is entirely at your own risk. Iron Fish Inc. and its contributors disclaim all liability for losses, damages, or claims arising from your use of the protocol, including but not limited to:

- Direct, indirect, or incidental damages.
- Loss of profits or digital assets.
- Security breaches or unauthorized access.
- Any other consequential damages arising from your inability to interact with the protocol or its services.

### No Liability

By using the Iron Fish protocol, you agree that no entity or individual involved in its creation, maintenance, or development will be held liable for any claims, damages, or losses related to your use of the protocol. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Loss of cryptocurrencies, tokens, or other assets.
- Network interruptions or failures.
- Errors or inaccuracies in the protocol or Website.

You agree to waive any claims or demands against Iron Fish Inc. and its contributors for any loss, damage, or liability related to your use of the protocol.

### Compliance and Tax Obligations

You are solely responsible for determining and fulfilling any legal or tax obligations related to your use of the Iron Fish protocol and associated services. We do not provide tax, financial, or legal advice and are not responsible for calculating or remitting taxes on your behalf.

### Security

While every effort is made to ensure the security of the protocol and Website, no system is entirely free from risks. You are responsible for safeguarding your private keys, wallet credentials, and any other sensitive information.

We cannot guarantee that the Website, protocol, or associated services are free from bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious code. As such, we strongly recommend that you take all necessary precautions to secure your interactions with the protocol, including using reputable wallet software and maintaining an up-to-date understanding of blockchain security best practices.

### Third-Party Interfaces

The Iron Fish protocol may be accessed through third-party applications or interfaces. We do not endorse, control, or take responsibility for any third-party services or content, including their fees, security, or functionality. Your use of third-party interfaces is entirely at your own risk, and you are solely responsible for evaluating their risks and benefits.

### Modifications and Termination

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue any part of the Website or protocol without prior notice. Any updates to these Terms of Use will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Website or protocol following any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.

### Arbitration and Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms of Use or your use of the Website or protocol shall be resolved through binding arbitration under the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS). Arbitration shall occur on an individual basis, and class arbitration is not permitted.
