### Creating a Transaction

Once your account has some assets, you can create transactions to spend notes
and transfer assets.

### Creating Raw Transactions

[Raw Transactions](/use/get-started/glossary#Raw-Transactions) contain all the
parameters needed to create a transaction on the Iron Fish chain. These include
notes to spend, output notes with recipients, assets to mint, assets to burn,
and a transaction fee. The Iron Fish RPC server can be used to create raw
transactions (see docs
[here](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/create_transaction)):

```js
async function main(): Promise<void> {
  const sdk = await IronfishSdk.init({ dataDir: '~/.dev0' });
  const client = await sdk.connectRpc();

  const from = '<sending account>';
  const to = '<recipient public address>';
  const assetId = '<optional asset identifier'>;
  const amount = '<amount>';
  const memo = '<memo>';
  const fee = <fee>;
  const expiration = <expiration sequence>;
  const confirmations = <confirmations>;

  const options = {
    account: from,
    outputs: [
      {
        publicAddress: to,
        amount: CurrencyUtils.encode(amount),
        memo,
        assetId,
      },
    ],
    fee: CurrencyUtils.encode(flags.fee),
    expiration,
    confirmations,
  };

  const response = await client.wallet.createTransaction(options);
  console.log(response);
}
```

### Posting Transactions

After raw transactions are created, they must be posted in order to be added to
the mempool and broadcasted to the network (see docs
[here](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/post_transaction)):

```js
async function main(): Promise<void> {
  const sdk = await IronfishSdk.init({ dataDir: '~/.dev0' });
  const client = await sdk.connectRpc();

  const from = '<sending account>';
  // RawTransactionSerde.serialize(rawTransaction).toString('hex')
  const transaction = '<serialized raw transaction>';
  // Optionally broadcast to network
  const broadcast = true;

  const options = {
    account: from,
    transaction,
    broadcast,
  };

  const response = await client.wallet.postTransaction(options);
  console.log(response);
}
```
