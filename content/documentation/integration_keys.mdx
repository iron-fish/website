Iron Fish keys are pieces of data which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data.
A [wallet](/use/get-started/glossary#Wallet) is a collection of many accounts,
and an account holds private [keys](/use/get-started/glossary#Keys) which enable users to view transaction details
and transfer assets to other
addresses.

> See more in the [glossary](/use/get-started/glossary)

## Create an Account

In order to create an account for your wallet, run the following:

```sh
ironfish wallet:create
```

The CLI will prompt you for a new account name and give you the public address:

```sh
Enter the name of the account: newaccount
Creating account newaccount
Account newaccount created with public address 986844f9f4b77e1c44583a97f190de4f97c5df58412abe1b3fdf5d294015a59e
Run "ironfish wallet:use newaccount" to set the account as default
✨  Done in 3.19s.
```

## Spending Keys and Addresses

The Iron Fish [Spending Key](/use/get-started/glossary#Spending-Keys) is a random seed which is used to derive other keys
in an account. Each Spending Key maps to one single public address.

## Keeping Keys Safe

Your private keys control your assets and allow you to interact with your
accounts. There is a common phrase in the crypto industry: “Not your keys, not
your crypto.” It’s highly recommended to secure your keys and keep them safe.

>> Note: Iron Fish wallets currently do not support key encryption.

There are several options to secure your keys.

### Offline USB Drive

Add your keys to an encrypted hard-drive, and ensure that device does not
connect to an online machine.

### Cryptosteel

There are stainless steel cards available for purchase online which can store
arbitrary characters (ex. mnemonic phrases). Many of these are fireproof and
waterproof.

### Paper Wallet

If you do not want to spend a lot of money, writing down keys on a piece of
paper stored in a fireproof and waterproof safe is a good backup option.

### Distribute Chunks

Take portions of your mnemonic phrase and store them in different locations.

## Exporting an Account

To export your account, run the following:

```sh
ironfish wallet:export <account>
```

Copy the output from this command:

```sh
ironfishaccount0000010....................................................................................fryk
```

## Importing an Account

To import an account on a new node or wallet, run the following using the output from an export:

```sh
ironfish wallet:import ironfishaccount0000010....................................................................................fryk
```

The output will confirm whether or not the account was successfully imported:

```sh
Account test imported.
Run "ironfish wallet:use test" to set the account as default
✨  Done in 2.50s.
```

## View-Only Wallets

If you’d like to monitor transactions related to an account without ability to
send transactions, you can use a view-only keys.

### Export View-Only Key

Run the following to export a view-only key:

```sh
ironfish wallet:export --viewonly <account>
```

Copy the output from this command:

```sh
ironfishaccount0000010....................................................................................
```

### Import View-Only Key

Run the following to import the view-only key:

```sh
ironfish wallet:import ironfishaccount0000010......
```

The node which imports this account can now view all related transactions but
won’t be able to spend any notes.
