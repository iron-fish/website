title: wallet/setAccountHead
description: RPC Wallet | Iron Fish Documentation
---

Update an account's head from `start` to `end. You must provide hashes of all transactions in which the account is either a sender or a recipient, or else the account's balances will be incorrect. You also must disable scanning with [`wallet/setScanning`](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/set_scanning) before calling this RPC.

This is useful to quickly catch up an account if you already know transactions belonging to that account.

Block hashes and transaction hashes are hex strings.

#### Request

```ts
{
  /**
   * Name of the account to update.
   */
  account: string
  /**
   * Starting block hash (inclusive). Used to verify that you haven't accidentally skipped
   * decrypting transactions in blocks between the account head and this block hash.
   * This block must connect to the account head with no gaps.
   */
  start: string
  /**
   * Last block hash (inclusive). Account head will be set to this
   * when the request finishes successfully.
   */
  end: string
  /**
   * Blocks between start and end (inclusive) that contain transactions in which the
   * account is either a sender or a recipient.
   */
  blocks: { hash: string; transactions: { hash: string }[] }[]
}
```

#### Response

```ts
undefined;
```
