Resets an account's head to its createdAt block (or to the genesis block, if `resetCreatedAt` is true). If `resetScanningEnabled` is true, `scanningEnabled` will be set to true, otherwise `scanningEnabled` will be left at its current value.

Useful if your account is missing transactions or balances are incorrect. Setting `resetCreatedAt` to true will start from the genesis block rather than the account head, which will take longer, but will fix accounts with an incorrect `createdAt` block.

#### Request

```ts
 {
  account: string
  resetCreatedAt?: boolean
  resetScanningEnabled?: boolean
}
```

#### Response

```ts
undefined
```
