title: wallet/importAccount
description: RPC Wallet | Iron Fish Documentation
---

Imports an encoded account and it's keys into the wallet.

The string is typically generated by the [`exportAccount` RPC](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/export_account), although the string can be [manually generated with the sdk](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/master/ironfish/src/wallet/account/encoder/account.ts).

The optional `createdAt` field can be used to set the block sequence to start scanning from for the imported account. Note that, if the account received any transactions on a block before this sequence, then those transactions will *not* appear in the account's balance.

#### Request

```ts
{
  account: string
  name?: string
  rescan?: boolean
  createdAt?: number
}
```

#### Response

```ts
{
  name: string;
  isDefaultAccount: boolean;
}
```
