title: wallet/buildTransaction
description: RPC Wallet | Iron Fish Documentation
---

Builds a raw transaction to produce an unsigned transaction. An unsigned transaction includes pre-computed zero-knowledge proofs for transaction spends and outputs, but is not yet signed.

Building a raw transaction does not require a spend key. Unsigned transactions are not added to the wallet, mempool, or broadcast.

Use the [`wallet/createTransaction`](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/create_transaction) RPC to create a raw transaction.

#### Request

```ts
{
  account?: string
  rawTransaction: string
}
```

#### Response

```ts
{
  unsignedTransaction: string;
}
```
