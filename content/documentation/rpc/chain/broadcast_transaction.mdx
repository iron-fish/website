Broadcast a transaction to the node's peers.

This is a one time broadcast. If the transaction fails to broadcast it will not be rebroadcast. This is in comparison to the wallet which rebroadcasts pending transactions at an interval.

This will also add the transaction to the node's mempool.

#### Request

```ts
{
  transaction: string;
}
```

#### Response

```ts
{
  hash: string;
  broadcasted: boolean;
  accepted: boolean;
}
```

- **hash** The transaction hash
- **broadcasted** true if the transaction was successfully sent out to the network.
- **accepted** true if the transaction was accepted into the node's mempool
