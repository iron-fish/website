title: chain/getNoteWitness
description: RPC Chain | Iron Fish Documentation
---

Gets a witness (merkle path) to a specified note in the note merkle tree.
This witness is necessary for creating a transaction that spends the note.

This endpoint would primarily be used to construct transactions without using
the Iron Fish wallet.

The returned `treeSize` and `rootHash` values will always reference the note
merkle tree state at `confirmations` blocks behind current HEAD of the chain. If
no value is provided for `confirmations`, then the value from the node's
configuration will be used.  If the chain experiences a re-org and that block
moves to a fork, this witness will no longer be usable in a transaction.

#### Request

```js
{
  index: number;
  confirmations?: number;
}
```

#### Response

```js
{
  treeSize: number
  rootHash: string
  authPath: Array<{
    side: 'Left' | 'Right'
    hashOfSibling: string
  }>
}
```
