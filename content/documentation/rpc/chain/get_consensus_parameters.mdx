   * When adding a block, the block can be this amount of seconds into the future
   * without rejecting it
   */
  allowedBlockFutureSeconds: number

  /**
   * The amount of coins in the genesis block
   */
  genesisSupplyInIron: number

  /**
   * The average time that all blocks should be mined
   */
  targetBlockTimeInSeconds: number

  /**
   * The time range when difficulty and target not change
   */
  targetBucketTimeInSeconds: number

  /**
   * Max block size
   */
  maxBlockSizeBytes: number

  /**
   * The minimum fee that a transaction must have to be accepted
   */
  minFee: number

  /**
   * The block height that enables the use of V2 transactions instead of V1
   */
  enableAssetOwnership: number | null

  /**
   * Before upgrade we have block timestamp smaller than previous block. After this
   * block we enforce the block timestamps in the sequential order as the block sequences.
   */
  enforceSequentialBlockTime: number | null

  /**
   * Sequence at which to start mining and validating blocks with the FishHash algorithm
   * instead Blake3. This sequence also modifies the block header serialization to move graffiti
   * to the beginning of the block header before mining.
