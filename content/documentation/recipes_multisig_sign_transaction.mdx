**Learn how to create multisignature accounts [here](./recipes_multisig_create_account).**

Once you have created the multisignature accounts, signing a transaction involves the following steps: 
1. Create an unsigned transaction for participants to sign
2. Create the signing commitment (performed by each participant)
3. Aggregate the signing commitments to create the signing package (performed by a coordinator)
4. Create signature shares using the signing package (performed by each participant)
5. Aggregate the signature shares to create the final signed transaction (performed by a coordinator)

In the examples below, we will be signing a transaction with 2 of 2 multisig accounts.

## Create the unsigned transaction

Any account in the multisig group (or a view-only account that possesses the group view keys) can initiate sending a transaction by generating an "unsigned transaction". A raw transaction contains the parameters of a transaction, like which notes will be spent, which notes will be created, and who will own the notes. An unsigned transaction contains pre-computed zero-knowledge proofs in its spend, output, mint, and burn descriptions, but lacks the authorizing signature required for valid spends and mints.

The example below shows how to create a raw transaction to send 10 $ORE to two addresses and then generate an unsigned transaction from that raw transaction:

```js
import { Asset } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'
import {
  BuildTransactionRequest,
  CreateTransactionRequest,
  CurrencyUtils,
  IronfishSdk,
} from '@ironfish/sdk'

async function main(): Promise<void> {
  const sdk = await IronfishSdk.init({ dataDir: '~/.dev0' });
  const client = await sdk.connectRpc();

  const accountName = 'MyMultisigAccount';

  // Create the raw transaction
  const createOptions: CreateTransactionRequest = {
    account: accountName,
    outputs: [
      {
        publicAddress: 'b28b5d5a629b57f15e73ee6040efe9a8a0abca54a439e9ef5a8686b5765684ee',
        amount: CurrencyUtils.encode(10n),
        memo: '',
        assetId: Asset.nativeId().toString('hex'),
      },
      {
        publicAddress: '34ba96315e36de52a3138475776f91df215ebbd868757c61a32dfe34563bd51f',
        amount: CurrencyUtils.encode(10n),
        memo: '',
        assetId: Asset.nativeId().toString('hex'),
      },
    ],
    fee: CurrencyUtils.encode(1n),
    // don't expire until 60 blocks from the current chain head to allow enough time for signing
    expirationDelta: 60,
  };

  const createResponse = await client.wallet.createTransaction(createOptions);
  const rawTransaction = createResponse.content.transaction;

  // Build the raw transaction to create an unsigned transaction
  const buildOptions: BuildTransactionRequest = {
    account: accountName,
    rawTransaction,
  };

  const buildResponse = await client.wallet.buildTransaction(buildOptions);
  console.log(buildResponse.content.unsignedTransaction);
}
```

**Tip:** Make sure the unsigned transaction has a sufficient expiration time to allow for the completion of the signing process. The expiration can be set to 0 to ensure the transaction never expires. 

## Create the signing commitment 

Once the participants agree on the contents of a transaction and who is going to participate in signing, each participant will create a signing commitment. 

The identities of the participant and the unsigned transaction are required to generate a commitment. 

```js
import { multisig } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'

const participantIdentities = [
    "723729d1b6af022a4c5d67e126a3a797...63ec486317bd1e72b8628e6116340304",
    "72c60942feac595aa83bb0856c264dfc...af2708a2961ef6c9e15541e288dcad03"
]

const participantCommitment = multisig.createSigningCommitment( 
    participantAccount.multisigKeys.secret,
    participantAccount.multisigKeys.keyPackage,
    unsignedTransaction.hash(),
    participantIdentities,
)
```

## Aggregate the signing commitments to create the signing package

Once all participants have created their signing commitments, the commitments are aggregated to create the signing package.

**Note:** This action can be performed by any participant or the coordinator.

```js
import { UnsignedTransaction } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'

const unsignedTransactionData = "01010000000000000002000000000000...9f3fb432907a84c8483586a6a565d308"

const unsignedTransaction = new UnsignedTransaction(
    Buffer.from(unsignedTransactionData, 'hex'),
)

const participantCommitments = [
    "723f415e10ec47955036105834ab7dcc...342022941ff351bd60723b9a9aa2d29a",
    "721cb9582cec837588df0b08d77d4870...abc27377671c68323af864b57b718380"
]

const signingPackage = unsignedTransaction.signingPackage(participantCommitments)
```

## Create signature shares

Once the signing package is created and distributed to all participants, each participant can create a signature share using their secret key and the signing package.

```js
import { multisig } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'

const participantSignature = multisig.createSignatureShare(
    participantAccount.multisigKeys.secret,
    participantAccount.multisigKeys.keyPackage,
    signingPackage,
)
```

## Aggregate the signature shares to create the signed transaction

Once all participants have created their signature shares, the shares are aggregated to create the final signed transaction.

**Note:** This action can be performed by any participant or the coordinator.

```js
import { multisig } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'

const participantSignatures = [
    "723f415e10ec47955036105834ab7dcc...be94dd1ae640f3fcf8bddb9478a0cb02", 
    "721cb9582cec837588df0b08d77d4870...ad47e9f3ba751c77ec7530708d1d2b07"
]

const serialized = multisig.aggregateSignatureShares(
    coordinatorAccount.multisigKeys.publicKeyPackage,
    signingPackage,
    participantSignatures,
)

const transaction = new Transaction(serialized)
```
