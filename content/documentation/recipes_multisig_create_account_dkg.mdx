title: Creating Multisig Accounts With DKG

Iron Fish supports multisig accounts using FROST, a threshold signature scheme. This recipe reviews how to create accounts using distributed key generation (DKG).

### Creating participant identities

Each signer or participant in a multisig account must have a unique identity. The participant identity is a public key derived from a participant's secret key and allows other participants to encrypt data before sending it.

The example below shows how to generate a random signer identity using the Iron Fish SDK:

```js
import { multisig } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'

const secret = multisig.ParticipantSecret.random()
const identity = secret.toIdentity()
```

You can also use the [`wallet/multisig/createParticipant`](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/multisig/create_participant) RPC to create a participant identity and store the participant secret key in the wallet.

### Running round 1 for each participant

Once all participants have created their secrets, each participant will need to run round 1 of DKG.

The example below shows how to run round 1 using the Iron Fish SDK:

```js
import { multisig } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'

// This is our own identity, generated from the previous step
const selfIdentity = '72173b37ef74412e5d0b79831505eb61...4fe930e60abdd0274ac3c0577112e503'

const minSigners = 2
const participantIdentities = [
  '723729d1b6af022a4c5d67e126a3a797...63ec486317bd1e72b8628e6116340304', // participant X
  '72c60942feac595aa83bb0856c264dfc...af2708a2961ef6c9e15541e288dcad03', // participant Y
]

const { round1SecretPackage, round1PublicPackage } = multisig.round1(
  identity,
  minSigners,
  participantIdentities
)
```

You can also use the [`wallet/multisig/dkg/round1`](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/multisig/dkg/round1) RPC to run round 1 and create the round 1 packages.

### Running round 2 for each participant

Once all participants have run round 1, each participant will need to collect the round 1 public package from the other participants.

> **Note**: It is critical that you pass in your own public package from the previous step in addition to the rest of the public packages that the group generated.

The example below shows how to run round 2 using the Iron Fish SDK:

```js
import { multisig } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'

// This is our own secret, generated from the first step
const secret = '...'

const round1PublicPackages = [
  round1PublicPackage, // round 1 public package we generated
  '...',               // round 1 public package from participant X
  '...',               // round 1 public package from participant Y
]

const { round2SecretPackage, round2PublicPackage } = multisig.round2(
  secret,
  round1SecretPackage,
  round1PublicPackages
)
```

You can also use the [`wallet/multisig/dkg/round2`](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/multisig/dkg/round2) RPC to run round 2 and create the round 2 packages.

### Running round 3 for each participant

Once all participants have run round 2, each participant will need to collect the round 2 public packages from the other participants.

> **Note**: The encrypted secret package must be the one that you generated in round2. You must pass in your encrypted round 2 secret package, all of the public packages from round 1 (*including* your own), and all of the public packages from round 2 (*excluding* your own).

The example below shows how to run round 3 using the Iron Fish SDK:

```js
import { multisig } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'

// This is our own secret, generated from the first step
const secret = '...'

const round1PublicPackages = [
  round1PublicPackage, // round 1 public package we generated
  '...',               // round 1 public package from participant X
  '...',               // round 1 public package from participant Y
]

const round2PublicPackages = [
  '...',               // round 2 public package from participant X
  '...',               // round 2 public package from participant Y
]

const {
  publicAddress,
  keyPackage,
  publicKeyPackage,
  viewKey,
  incomingViewKey,
  outgoingViewKey,
  proofAuthorizingKey,
} = multisig.round3(
  secret,
  round2SecretPackage,
  round1PublicPackages,
  round2PublicPackages
)
```

You can also use the [`wallet/multisig/dkg/round3`](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/multisig/dkg/round3) RPC to run round 3 and create the round 3 packages.

> **Note**: If using the RPC for round3, the account will automatically be imported.

### Importing the account

The `publicAddress`, `publicKeyPackage`, `viewKey`, `incomingViewKey`, `outgoingViewKey`, and `proofAuthorizingKey` in the example are all shared keys for the multisig account. `keyPackages` contains one key package per participant and contains the participant's share of the signing key.

The example below shows how to import a multisig account after running round 3:

```js
import { multisig } from '@ironfish/rust-nodejs'

// Setup the node
const node = ...

const {
  publicAddress,
  keyPackage,
  publicKeyPackage,
  viewKey,
  incomingViewKey,
  outgoingViewKey,
  proofAuthorizingKey,
} = multisig.round3(
  secret,
  round2SecretPackage,
  round1PublicPackages,
  round2PublicPackages
)

const account = await node.wallet.importAccount({
  name: '<insert_account_name>',
  version: ACCOUNT_SCHEMA_VERSION,
  createdAt: null,
  spendingKey: null,
  viewKey,
  incomingViewKey,
  outgoingViewKey,
  publicAddress,
  proofAuthorizingKey,
  multisigKeys: {
    identity,
    keyPackage,
    publicKeyPackage,
  },
})
```
