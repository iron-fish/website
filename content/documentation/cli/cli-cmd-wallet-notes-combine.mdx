# Motivation

The time it takes to send a transaction is proportional to the number of notes (UTXOs) that are being spent in that transaction. The process of creating proofs for your notes is time intensive and depends on your machines CPU. If your transaction includes too many notes, it will take a long time to send. In addition to that, if your expiration is too short, you may not be able to send the transaction in time. All of this leads to your transactions being "stuck".

We created this command to help consolidate your notes while taking into account your machines performance.
