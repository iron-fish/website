seo: Wallet Multisig Commitment Aggregate command

# Usage

Aggregates signing commitments from a group of multisig signers for a given transaction to produce a signing package.

```sh
ironfish wallet:multisig:commitment:aggregate
```

The example below aggregates signing commitments for a transaction to be signed by two signers.

The unsigned transaction, signing commitments, and signing package in the example are truncated for readability.

<Terminal command="ironfish wallet:multisig:commitment:aggregate \
-c 723f415e10ec47955036105834ab7dcc...342022941ff351bd60723b9a9aa2d29a \
-c 721cb9582cec837588df0b08d77d4870...abc27377671c68323af864b57b718380 \
-u 01010000000000000002000000000000...9f3fb432907a84c8483586a6a565d308"
  output={`
Signing Package for commitments from 2 participants:

f100000000c3d2051e0257eb8aaee9aa...9844a3e90873a5a5808e83417c336105
  `}
/>

# Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `-c, --commitment | Signing commitment from participant (may be specified multiple times) ||
| `-f, --account` | The account to use for generating the commitment, must be a multisig participant account | The wallet's default account is used |
| `-u, --unsignedTransaction` | The serialized unsigned transaction that needs to be signed ||
| `--path` | Path to a JSON file containing unsigned transaction and commitments ||

# Multisig Transaction JSON

You can use the `--path` flag and a JSON file like the example shown below to pass an unsigned transaction and list of commitments to this command:

```json
{
  "commitment": [
    "723f415e10ec47955036105834ab7dcc...342022941ff351bd60723b9a9aa2d29a",
    "721cb9582cec837588df0b08d77d4870...abc27377671c68323af864b57b718380"
  ],
  "unsignedTransaction": "01010000000000000002000000000000...9f3fb432907a84c8483586a6a565d308"
}
```

Note that the JSON file can contain other fields, like `identity`, so you can use the same file throughout the multisig signing flow.
