It's some times important to be able to export transactions for accountants or tax preparation agents.

You can do this with the `wallet:transactions` command

Here is an example that exports the transactions for all wallets between October 1st, 2024 and November 1st, 2024.

```bash
ironfish wallet:transactions \
    --no-account \
    --filter.start 10/1/2024 \
    --filter.end 11/01/2024 \
    --output csv \
    --format transfers
```

**Notes**
 - `--format=transfers` will project the data in an accounting friendly format which excludes change notes
 - `--no-account` will ensure that all wallets are included. Only the default account is included otherwise.

If you want to export transactions for a specific set of accounts, like `alice` and `bob`, you can specify each like this:

```bash
ironfish wallet:transactions \
    --account alice \
    --account bob \
    --filter.start 10/1/2024 \
    --filter.end 11/01/2024 \
    --output csv \
    --format transfers
```
