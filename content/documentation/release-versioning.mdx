title: Release Versioning
description: Release Versioning | Iron Fish Onboarding

We use a 3-number version: **major.default.patch**

Example: 1.12.1

- **major** will be used for major changes, usually requiring a hard-fork
- **default** will be the default version increase when making a release. We will do our best to document breaking changes in the release notes.
- **patch** will be used only for small changes, usually fixing a regression in a **default** release or very minor changes.

An example of a **patch** release: https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/releases/tag/v1.0.1

This release had minor text changes to the CLI and a minor addition to one of the API payloads. It did not include any changes to the SDK or core logic of the node.

### Backwards Compatibility

We aim to give a 2-week notice on deprecations. For example, if we add new fields to an RPC payload to replace existing ones, we will keep the existing ones for a minimum of 2 weeks. We will include these deprecation notices in the release notes of the release that counts as the starting point.
