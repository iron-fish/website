title: Run your own local network
description: Integration Guide | Local Network | Iron Fish Documentation
---

To test out integration or workflows, it’s generally easier to run your own
network rather than using the testnet or mainnet and waiting for funds. Iron
Fish has a devnet with low difficulty which enables easy block mining and
transfers.

You can read more about our included networks in the [networks documentation](/developers/documentation/networks).

## Start a Local Node

Run the following command to start a node on the development network:

```sh
ironfish start --networkId=2 --port=9001 --bootstrap='' --forceMining --datadir=~/.dev0
```

- `networkId`: Network ID 2 is the development network
- `port`: Optionally set the running port for the node
- `bootstrap`: Set this to an empty string to avoid connecting to the default network
- `forceMining`: Enables mining of blocks without being fully synced or connecting to other nodes
- `datadir`: Defines the file directory on where to store the node’s data

## Start a Second Node

Run the following command to connect to the first local node:

```sh
ironfish start --networkId=2 --port 9002 --bootstrap=localhost:9001 --datadir=~/.dev1
```

- `port`: This value must be different from the `port` of the first local node
- `datadir`: This value must be different from the `datadir` of the first local node

## Run a Miner

Run the following command to connect a miner to your node:

```sh
ironfish miners:start --threads=1 --datadir=~/.dev0
```

- `threads`: Sets the number of CPU threads for the miner to use
- `datadir`: Configures which data directory of the node to connect to via IPC
