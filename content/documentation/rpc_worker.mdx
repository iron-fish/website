## [worker/getStatus](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/master/ironfish/src/rpc/routes/worker/getStatus.ts)

Gets (and optionally streams) the status of the long-running jobs queued by the node's workers. 
The workers operate similar to a threadpool.

#### Request

```js
{
  stream?: boolean
} | undefined
```

#### Response

```js
{
  started: boolean
  workers: number
  queued: number
  capacity: number
  executing: number
  change: number
  speed: number
  jobs: Array<{
    name: string
    complete: number
    execute: number
    queue: number
    error: number
  }>
}
```
