This section describes how to listen to incoming transactions and decrypting notes.

## Transaction Streams

If your account is receiving transactions, you can use the Transaction Stream API (see [here](/developers/documentation/rpc/wallet/get_account_transactions)).

```js
async function main(): Promise<void> {
  const config = JSON.parse((await fsAsync.readFile('.ironfish.config.json')).toString());
  const sdk = await IronfishSdk.init(config);
  const client = await sdk.connectRpc();

  const account = '<account incoming view key>';
  const confirmations = <confirmations>;
  const head = <head sequence>;

  const options = {
    account,
    confirmations,
    head,
  };

  const response = await client.wallet.getAccountTransactionsStream(options);
  for await (const content of response.contentStream()) {
    console.log(content);
  }
}
```

It's recommended to configure confirmations to be greater than 0 if you'd like
confidence that a block has been confirmed with a low probability of a
reorganization. The default value used in Iron Fish is 2, but you can increase
this value for higher confidence.
