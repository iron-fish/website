To change configuration of your node, you can do so from the command line using the [config:set command](/use/get-started/cli-cmd-config-set).

For example, if you wanted to change the number of confirmed blocks necessary to calculate your balance, you could do so with:

```sh
ironfish config:set confirmations 3
```
