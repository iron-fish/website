The Iron Fish process exposes an RPC server which can be used to communicate
with nodes over TCP, IPC, and HTTP. The request and response patterns are
similar to JSON HTTP and also return streaming responses.

## API Reference

Refer to our [RPC docs](/developers/documentation/rpc/chain/broadcast_transaction)

## JavaScript SDK

Currently Iron Fish only supports a JavaScript SDK. An example interaction to
fetch your account's public address looks like:

```js
async function main(): Promise<void> {
  const sdk = await IronfishSdk.init({ dataDir: '~/.dev0' });
  const client = await sdk.connectRpc();

  const response = await client.wallet.getAccountPublicKey({
    account: '<account>',
  });
  console.log(response);
}
```

If you are not using JavaScript / TypeScript, it's recommended to write your own
client that interacts with the node over HTTP, TCP, or IPC.

## HTTP Adapter

If you'd like to enable HTTP binding to your RPC server, run the following:

```sh
ironfish config:set enableRpcHttp true
ironfish config:set rpcHttpHost 0.0.0.0
```

You can similarly configure rpcHttpHost and rpcHttpPort if you'd like to
customize the host and port.
