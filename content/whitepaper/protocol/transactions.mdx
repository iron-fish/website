title: Transactions
---

A transaction is a data structure on the Iron Fish chain that has a list of actions that modify the global state of the blockchain. Such actions (referred to as “descriptions” in the reference code implementation) can:

- Spend existing notes
- Create (output) new notes
- Increase (mint) or decrease (burn) the supply of a custom asset
- Changing ownership (mint permissions) for an asset

These actions have hidden state to protect user’s privacy when value is transferred. For most other chains validation of correct state transition relies on transparency. In Iron Fish, validation of correct state transition of hidden state is done through the use of zero-knowledge proofs—a proof system called a zk-SNARK, and more specifically [groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf).

The action of transferring value between accounts involves encrypted data such that only the view keys of the sender and recipient of the transaction are able to view those details. To everyone else, this action is opaque. Iron Fish does not support sending tokens in cleartext (not encrypted) form.

Other actions such as creating new asset types, increasing the supply of a custom asset type through minting, burning an asset, or changing mint permission of a custom asset have some public state. In particular, any Iron Fish participant may know the total supply of a given asset. To summarize what is revealed during each action of a transaction, refer to the diagram below (🔒 = encrypted and 👁️ = public knowledge).

| Description                   | Sender | Recipient | Amount | Asset Type |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | --------- | ------ | ---------- |
| [Spend](#spend-description)   | 🔒     | 🔒        | 🔒     | 🔒         |
| [Output](#output-description) | 🔒     | 🔒        | 🔒     | 🔒         |
| [Mint](#mint-description)     | 👁️     | N/A       | 👁️     | 👁️         |
| [Burn](#burn-description)     | 🔒     | N/A       | 👁️     | 👁️         |

Transactions are incorporated into blocks of the Iron Fish chain. The operation of incorporating transactions into blocks is called **mining**.

## Transaction Balancing

A transaction always has at least one **spend** and additionally has **outputs, mints, and burns**. The key property of a transaction is that the Pedersen commitments to the values in all of the transaction components balance in relation to the specified fee in \$IRON such that:

$$\text{spends} - \text{outputs} = \text{fee} - \text{mints} + \text{burns}$$

The fee must be strictly greater than zero, denominated in the native asset IRON, and is awarded to an address specified by the miner that mined the block that included that transaction. This implies that every transaction (excluding the Miner’s Fee Transaction) must always have tokens of the native asset (\$IRON) as one of the inputs.

For more specific details, see [Transaction Balancing Proof](#transaction-balancing-proof) section.

## Notes and Nullifiers

The way a transaction may add or remove value from an account is by creating or destroying **[Notes](#note)**. A note is a structure that encodes the value, asset type, the original sender, and the owner of the tokens. A note is only created from the Output component of a transaction, which can be a result of a Spend or a Mint within the same transaction, or as part of the [Miner Reward Transaction](#miner-reward-transaction).

Notes within a transaction are always encrypted on the Iron Fish chain and only the view keys of the sender or receiver may be able to decrypt them.

A note is considered spent such that it cannot be spent again in the future, by revealing its [**Nullifier**](#nullifier): a special construct that allows referencing a note without revealing the note contents, or when the note was created. Nullifiers are unique to the note, and a note can only have one nullifier. This property allows validators to detect when a transaction attempts to spend a note that was already spent in a previous transaction (preventing double spends).

## Transaction Structure

A transaction is a collection of **descriptions**, which describe the actions performed by the transactions. There are currently 4 descriptions:

- [**Spend Description:**](#spend-description) used to describe the tpends of a transaction; contains a Nullifier, which references a note that gets spent as part of the transaction, as well as a zero-knowledge proof to demonstrate that the note is owned by the account that generated the transaction, and that the revealed nullifier for the note was computed correctly.
- [**Output Description:**](#output-description) used to create new notes
- [**Mint Description:**](#mint-description) used to create new assets, or to increase the supply of existing custom assets given permissions. A Mint Description allows for the transaction to have an accompanying Output Description that creates new notes with the allowed balance and asset type.
- [**Burn Description:**](#burn-description) used to decrease the supply of existing assets. A Burn Description must have a corresponding Spend Description.

In addition to a collection of descriptions, a transaction also contains:

- the **version** which is the transaction serialization version that’s incremented with non-backwards compatible updates
- the **fee**, expressed as number in plaintext of tokens of the native asset (\$IRON)
- the **expiration** for when the transaction should be rejected from the mempool (the value 0 indicates that the transaction does not expire)
- a **randomized public key (rk)**, used for verification of the descriptions (see [Randomized Public Key](#randomized-public-key))
- a **binding signature**, used to verify that the balance equation is respected (see [Transaction Balancing Proof](#transaction-balancing-proof))

## Miner Reward Transaction

The Iron Fish protocol allows a special kind of transaction, called Miner Reward Transaction, which has the property that it allows a negative fee. The Miner Reward Transaction *must* be the first transaction in the list of transaction for a block, otherwise the block is considered invalid.

The purpose of the Miner Reward Transaction is to allow an Iron Fish miner (see [Mining](/learn/whitepaper/protocol/blocks#block-mining)) to generate new tokens of the native asset (\$IRON) as a reward for producing a block that is accepted by the network and valid by consensus rules. Because this transaction is meant to have no spends and have only outputs, and because the native asset cannot be minted, the only way to respect the [transaction balance equation](#transaction-balancing-proof) is to have a negative fee:

$$
\cancel{\text{spends}} - \text{outputs} = \text{fee} - \cancel{\text{mints}} + \cancel{\text{burns}} \\
\text{fee} = - \text{outputs}
$$

The miner reward transaction has the special property that its fee can be negative, and thus it’s *creating* new tokens of the native asset (\$IRON). The value of this negative fee must be the sum of outputs, which must be the block reward plus the sum of transaction fees included in the block (see [Block Reward](/learn/whitepaper/protocol/blocks#block-reward)).

## Transaction Verification

Any Iron Fish transaction can be verified for correctness by any Iron Fish participant. Verifying a transaction employs the following steps:

1. Checking that all the zero-knowledge proofs attached to [Descriptions](#descriptions) within transactions are valid
2. Checking that all the signatures attached to [Descriptions](#descriptions) are valid
3. Checking that the transaction balances (see [Transaction Balancing Proof](#transaction-balancing-proof))

## Randomized Public Key

The randomized public key (rk) is constructed from the authorization key (ak) of the account that created the transaction, and a random element ar from the JubJub group scalar field:

```jsx
rk = ak + ar * SPENDING_KEY_GENERATOR
```

The zero-knowledge circuit references the element ar to ensure the validity of rk that is used to sign the transaction descriptions (see [Descriptions](#descriptions) for more details). It is not public information and it is never exposed so no other Iron Fish participant may access it. The randomized public key (rk) is then used to prove that the transaction is spending notes that belong to the account that created of the transaction, without revealing any information about the account.

Because the randomized public key (rk) is different for each and every transaction (provided that the value ar is different every time), it is not possible for a generic Iron Fish participant to tell whether two arbitrary transactions originated from the same account.

## Note

A note is the most basic data structure that describes an asset on Iron Fish. An Iron Fish note in plaintext contains:

- The **owner**’s transmission key (pk), or public address
- The **value** of the note
- The **note randomness** that ensures notes are indistinguishable from each other when hashed
- The **memo** field which is a 32 byte field on the note that can be used for arbitrary data
- The **sender** field, which is the transmission key (pk), or public key, of the sender of the note. If this note is the block reward for mining a block, the sender is the miner that mined the block.
- The **asset identifier** is a 32-byte hash representing the asset type for the note

The plaintext version of the note is never saved on chain—it’s only saved as an encrypted data blob (see [Note Encryption and Decryption](#note-encryption-and-decryption)).

## Note Commitment

The note commitment is a hash of the Note. The contents of the Note that are hashed are in this order:

- **asset identifier** (32 bytes)
- **value** (8 bytes)
- **owner** (32 bytes)
- **sender** (32 bytes)

```jsx
note_contents = asset_identifier || value || owner || sender
```

The hash function used to construct the Merkle tree of notes is the Pedersen hash on the JubJub group, which can be computed efficiently in SNARK circuits.

The note commitment is the u coordinate of the commitment full point:

```jsx
commitment_full_point =(NOTE_COMMITMENT_RANDOMNESS_GENERATOR * rcm) + hash_of_contents
note_commitment = commitment_full_point.get_u()
```

## Nullifier

The nullifier is what is used to ensure that a note is not allowed to be spent more than one time (e.g. it is used to prevent a double spend). A nullifier is computed as:

```jsx
rho = cm + NULLIFIER_POSITION_GENERATOR * position_of_the_note
nullifier = blake2s::blake2s(persnalization: PRF_NF_PERSONALIZATION, nk || rho)
```

Where:

- `cm` is the note commitment of the note being spent
- `nk` is the nullifier deriving key (see [Account Creation](/learn/whitepaper/protocol/accounts)).

When a note is spent as part of the [Spend Description](#spend-description) in a Transaction, its nullifier is publicly revealed. Full nodes keep track of previously revealed nullifiers and disallow Spend Descriptions that reveal previously seen nullifiers. The integrity of the nullifier is checked in the zero-knowledge proof of the Spend Description to ensure that it is computed correctly.

## Merkle Tree of Notes

Iron Fish tracks all notes ever created in a binary Merkle tree called the **Merkle Tree of notes**. In this tree, every leaf node contains a note commitment, and is labeled with the hash of the note. Every node that is not a leaf is labeled with the hash of the child nodes.

The hash function used to construct the Merkle tree of notes is the Pedersen hash on the JubJub group, which can be computed efficiently in SNARK circuits.

The Merkle tree of notes has a fixed height of 32, and as such it can contain up to $2^{32}$ notes.

The Merkle tree of notes is an append-only data structure: notes can be added but never removed from it (spent notes instead are invalidated using nullifiers). Because the Merkle tree of notes has a maximum size, once it gets full, a brand new tree is constructed from scratch and the old one becomes read-only.

## Asset

An asset is custom private token supported by the Iron Fish blockchain. The mint and burn operation for an asset is public knowledge, but all subsequent asset transfers are private—custom assets and native assets all share the same anonymity pool and transactions do not reveal which assets are being transacted.

An asset is uniquely identified and constructed from the following 4 fields:

- **name**: an arbitrary 32-byte string. By convention, this is usually a utf-8 string padded with 0 bytes
- **metadata**: an arbitrary 96-byte string. By convention, this is usually a utf-8 string padded with 0 bytes
- **creator**: the public address of the account that first created the asset
- **nonce**: a 1-byte number that allows constructing a valid generator (see [Generator](#generator) below for information about why this is needed)

These fields are immutable and cannot be altered once the asset is created.

Assets are also characterized by 2 properties that are derived from the 4 fields above:

- **identifier**: a 32-byte string. This can be used to uniquely identify the asset as an alternative to the 4-tuple (name, metadata, creator, nonce). (See [Identifier](#identifier) section for details on how this is constructed.)
- **generator**: an element of the JubJub group that is used to [check that the transaction balances](#transaction-balancing-proof). See [Generator](#generator) section below for details on how this is constructed.

Because both the identifier and the generator are derived from the 4 immutable fields, these properties are also immutable.

Assets also have a supply and an owner. The **supply** is the number of tokens (denominated in ore, such that 1 ore = 0.00000001 \$IRON) that are available to spend. Supply can be increased or decreased by the owner of an asset using mint and burn transactions. The supply at a given time can be calculated by aggregating all mint and burn transactions that ever happened on the chain.

The **owner** is the public address of the account that may mint or burn the asset. By default, the owner and the creator are the same, but the owner may be changed at any time to an arbitrary public address using an optional transfer field as part of the [Mint Description](#mint-description).

#### Identifier

The identifier of an asset is a 32-byte string that is constructed from the 256-bit Blake2s hash of the 4 fields of an asset: name, metadata, creator, and nonce.

More specifically, it is constructed as follows:

```jsx
identifier = blake2s(
  0x096b36a5804bfacef1691e173c366a47ff5ba84a44f26ddd7e8d9f79d5b42df0
  || creator
  || name
  || metadata
  || nonce,
  length: 256 bits,
  personalization: "ironf_A_")
```

#### Generator

The generator is an element of the JubJub group that generates a subgroup. It is unique per asset, and is derived from the identifier (which in turn is derived from the name, metadata, creator, and nonce).

The generator is constructed first by computing the 256-bit Blake2s hash of the identifier:

```jsx
identifier_hash = blake2s(identifier, length: 256 bits, personalization: "ironf_cv")
```

The hash is then interpreted as an affine point on the JubJub curve in compressed form. This point is the generator.

The map between the hash of the identifier and a JubJub curve point is not bijective (not all hashes can be interpreted as affine points in compressed form), therefore this last operation may fail in the general case. A valid asset must contain a nonce that allows the constructor of a generator.

When constructing a new asset, one may try all nonces from 0 to 255 until one that yields a valid generator is found. The chances that a random 256 bit string maps to an affine point in compressed form is about 45%, so any naive algorithm (including “brute force”) for choosing a nonce can find a valid nonce in an acceptable time.

#### Native Asset

The asset that is used for miner rewards and transaction fees is special: it is called **native asset** or **\$IRON**, and is not constructed as described above.

The native asset is not constructed from the 4-tuple (name, metadata, creator, nonce) but has a fixed identifier:

```jsx
51f33a2f14f92735e562dc658a5639279ddca3d5079a6d1242b2a588a9cbf44c
```

The native asset does not have a creator or owner. Attempting to construct the native asset identifier from a 4-tuple above requires solving the preimage problem for the Blake2s hash function. As such, no Iron Fish account may ever mint or burn the native asset. The supply for the native asset is entirely controlled by miner rewards and may only increase over time.

## Transaction Balancing Proof

A transaction may have some private input and output values (the note values), and some public input and output values (fee, mints, and burns). Nonetheless, every Iron Fish participant is able to verify the balance equation for a given transaction:

$$\text{spends} - \text{outputs} = \text{fee} - \text{mints} + \text{burns}$$

The way this equation is verified without revealing the private values is through **value commitments (cv)**. A commitment is a cryptographic construct that is bound to a hidden message: the commitment does not reveal any information of the message, but altering the message would make the commitment invalid. In the context of Iron Fish, a value commitment is a commitment on the value of a note that is part of a spend or an output. Value commitments are implemented as Pedersen commitments on the JubJub group.

For a given value *v* expressing the number of tokens of an asset *A*, its value commitment (cv) is calculated first by generating a random number *rnd*, and then calculating the following:

$$cv = v G_A h + r G_R$$

Where:

- $G_A$ is the **asset generator**: an element of the JubJub group that is unique per asset. See [hash-to-point](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/master/ironfish-zkp/src/util.rs#L59) and [asset to hash](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/v1.12.0/ironfish-rust/src/assets/asset.rs#L71) function for information of how this is constructed from the identifier of the asset.
- $G_R$ is the [Value Commitment Randomness Generator](/learn/whitepaper/protocol/crypto-primitives#generators)
- $h$ is the cofactor of the JubJub group. $G_A$ is multiplied by the cofactor because it is an arbitrary JubJub group element, as such it may generate a subgroup of composite order. $G_R$ instead is not multiplied by the cofactor because that is a fixed element that is known to generate a subgroup of prime order.

Each spend description and output description contains a value commitment (cv) for the value of their note.

The value commitment (cv) is computed only for private values (the note values). For all other public values (fee, mints, and burns) an analogous of the value commitment (cv) called **pseudo-value commitment (pcv)** can be calculated as follows:

$$pcv = v G_A h$$

This is essentially the same expression as before with $r = 0$. Note that the pseudo-value commitments (pcv) can be calculated on the fly by any Iron Fish participant as the formula to calculate them only contains only public information.

By appropriately combining each value commitment and pseudo-value commitment, one can obtain an analogue of the transaction balance equation:

$$cv_\text{spends} - cv_\text{outputs} = pcv_\text{fee} - pcv_\text{mints} + pcv_\text{burns} + R$$

Where R represents the contribution of all the $r G_R$ terms that appear in the value commitments:

$$R = \sum_{s \in \text{spends}} r_s G_R - \sum_{o \in \text{outputs}} r_o G_R = \left(\sum_{s \in \text{spends}} r_s - \sum_{o \in \text{outputs}} r_o\right) G_R$$

The sum of the r terms (taken with appropriate signs) is called **binding signing key (bsk)**:

$$bsk = \sum_{s \in \text{spends}} r_s - \sum_{o \in \text{outputs}} r_o$$

R is called **binding validation key (bvk)**:

$$bvk = bsk G_R$$

These keys are used to implement digital signatures using the RedDSA scheme (a variant of the EdDSA scheme for the JubJub group).

Note that the binding signing key (bsk) can only be known to the creator of the transaction, while the binding verification key (bvk) can be computed by any Iron Fish participant by rearranging the terms of the previous equation:

$$bvk = cv_\text{spends} - cv_\text{outputs} - pcv_\text{fee} + pcv_\text{mints} - pcv_\text{burns}$$

The creator of the transaction uses the bsk to sign the transaction, and any Iron Fish participant can use the bvk to verify the signature. The process of verifying the signature ensures that the transaction balance equation is respected. In fact, any attempt to construct an unbalanced transaction would require solving the discrete logarithm problem for elliptic curves (ECDLP) due to the fact that the token amounts and the random numbers are multiplied by different generators whose relation is unknown.

The data that is signed is, more specifically:

```jsx
bvk || transaction_hash
```

Where bvk is represented as an affine point in compressed form (256 bits), and the transaction hash is computed as the 256-bit Blake2b hash of the serialized transaction, with personalization string `IFsighsh`. See [transaction hash function](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/v1.9.0/ironfish-rust/src/transaction/mod.rs#L372-L420) for precise details of how the transaction hash is constructed.

## Descriptions

#### Spend Description

A Spend Description is a component of a transaction that let’s a wallet **spend** its notes. The structure of a Spend Description contains:

- A **value commitment** of the note it’s spending
- The **root** of the Notes Merkle Tree that’s associated with the merkle path to the note used to create the zero-knowledge proof
- The **tree size** of how many leaves were in the tree when the root was created. This is not incorporated into the proof, but helps miners verify that the root hash the client supplied is valid in the tree faster.
- The resulting **nullifier** associated with the note being spent
- The **authorizing signature** using the randomized private key and randomized public key (**rk**)
- A **zero-knowledge proof**

See the [reference implementation](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/v1.12.0/ironfish-rust/src/transaction/spends.rs#L196) for more details.

At a high level, the zero-knowledge proof is a Groth16 zk-SNARK proof that any Iron Fish participant can use to verify the following statements:

- the authorizing key (ak) is a valid element of the JubJub subgroup of 255-bit prime order
- the randomized public key (rk) was properly constructed from the authorization key (ak) and randomness (see [Randomized Public Key](#randomized-public-key) for details about the construction of the randomized public key)
- the note being spent exists in the Merkle tree of notes
- the note being spent is owned by the creator of the transaction
- the note’s nullifier was computed correctly (see [Nullifier ](#nullifier) for details about how the nullifier is computed)

#### Output Description

An Output Description **creates** all new notes. The structure of an Output Description contains:

- The **ephemeral public key (epk)**. This is used to facilitate note encryption/decryption so the recipient is able to decrypt it with their set of keys.
- $C^{enc}$ a 152 byte encrypted blob. This is the encrypted blob that contains all the note information for the recipient to spend their funds in the future (see Note Encryption and Decryption).
- $C^{out}$ an 80 byte encrypted blob. This encrypted blob contains the **esk** (the private key component to the **epk**) that is decrypted using the sender’s outgoing view key (see Note Encryption and Decryption).
- A value commitment (**cv**) of the note

- A note commitment (**cm**), a Pedersen hash of the note (see Note Commitment)
- A **zero-knowledge proof**

See the [reference implementation](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/v1.12.0/ironfish-rust/src/transaction/outputs.rs#L127) for more details.

The proof is a Groth16 zk-SNARK proof that can be verified by any Iron Fish participant to prove the following statements:

- the authorizing key (ak) is a valid element of the JubJub subgroup of 255-bit prime order
- the randomized public key (rk) was properly constructed from the authorization key (ak) and randomness (see [Randomized Public Key](#randomized-public-key) for details about the construction of the randomized public key)
- the note commitment was computed correctly (see [Note Commitment](#note-commitment) for details about how the note commitment is computed)

#### Mint Description

A Mint Description **allows** the Transaction to create more of a custom asset through Output Description(s) in the same Transaction. Since notes can only be created by an Output Description, the Mint Description simply specifies how much **more** of a custom asset there should be.

A Mint Description is valid if it’s either being created by the owner of the asset, or by an address that is designated as the owner.

The structure of a Mint Description contains:

- An [Asset Identifier](#identifier) that can be used to construct the generator point unique to this asset used in [Transaction Balancing](#transaction-balancing-proof).
- The plaintext **value** for how much of the asset should be minted
- The current **owner** for an asset that has permission to mint, in plaintext
- An *optional* field for **transferring ownership to a new address**
- And a **zero-knowledge proof**

See the [reference implementation](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/v1.12.0/ironfish-rust/src/transaction/mints.rs#L147) for more details.

At a high level, the zero-knowledge proof on the Mint Description is a Groth16 zk-SNARK proof that any Iron Fish participant can use to verify the following statements:

- The **owner**’s authorizing key (ak) is a valid element of the JubJub subgroup of 255-bit prime order
- Given the publicly available key randomness (**rk**), ensure that it was derived from the owner’s authorizing key and **α** which is a point on the JubJub curve derived with randomness
- Ensure that the **owner** transmission key (or public key) is derived from the authorizing key

Creating a new custom asset is the same operation as minting more of an existing asset.

#### Burn Description

A Burn Description **allows** the Transaction to burn any Iron Fish asset through Spend Description(s) in the same Transaction. Since notes can only be consumed by a Spend Description, the Burn Description simply specifies how much **less** of an asset there should be. Unlike a spend description, which contains an encrypted note, a burn description contains only public data and any Iron Fish participant may read it for the purpose of knowing the supply of an asset.

The structure of a Burn Description contains:

- A 32 byte **asset identifier** of the asset its burning
- The plaintext **value** signifying how much of the asset is allowed to be burned

Notice that there is no zero-knowledge proof, and no signature attached to this Description. This is because the Spend Description contains a signature that signs the hash of all transaction contents, including any Burn Descriptions, tying it to the Transaction.

See the [reference implementation](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/blob/v1.12.0/ironfish-rust/src/transaction/burns.rs#L36) for more details.

## Note Encryption and Decryption

A note is spent as part of the Spend Description, and created as part of the Output Description. All notes are encrypted such that only the sender and recipient of a note may decrypt them, whereas other Iron Fish participants may not. More specifically, notes on the Output Description are encrypted in such way that the sender’s outgoing view key and recipient’s incoming view key are the only keys able to decrypt it. The encryption method is a hybrid encryption method involving the Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange scheme on the JubJub group, and ChaCha20-Poly1305.

There are 3 fields on the **Output Description** that facilitate Note encryption and decryption:

- The **ephemeral public key (epk)**
- $C^{enc}$ a 152 byte encrypted blob, that contains encrypted information for the recipient of a note
- $C^{out}$ an 80 byte encrypted blob, that contains encrypted information for the sender of a note

#### Encryption

When a sender sends a transaction to the recipient, the following happens:

1. An **ephemeral secret key (esk)** is randomly generated as a random JubJub group scalar field element
2. The **ephemeral public key (epk)** is generated from the esk as: `epk = esk * PUBLIC_KEY_GENERATOR`
3. A **shared secret** is computed using the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange as `shared_secret = esk * pk_recipient` where recipient is the transmission key (pk) of the recipient.

**Using the shared secret for symmetric encryption of the Note:**

Given a shared_secret, the **symmetric encryption key** is calculated as `symmetric_encryption_key = blake2b(shared_secret || epk, personalization: "Iron Fish shared")`

The plaintext Note is encrypted via ChaCha20-Poly1305 using the **symmetric encryption key** as $C^{enc}$ that’s saved on the Output Description.

Given the **shared secret**, one can also decrypt the Note by computing **symmetric encryption key** using the **shared secret** and publicly available data on the Output Description.

#### Decryption

**Using the recipient’s incoming view key**

The **shared secret** for the **recipient** is computed as: `epk * ivk_recipient`. This **shared secret** is then used to compute the **symmetric encryption key** in the same way as it was created during encryption:

```jsx
symmetric_encryption_key = blake2b(shared_secret || `epk`, personalization: "Iron Fish shared")
```

The recipient’s wallet then tries to decrypt incoming Notes on the incoming transactions via ChaCha20-Poly1305 using the **symmetric encryption key**.

Because all transactions are private, it’s not possible for an account to know which output descriptions the account is a recipient for.

In order to received notes, an account needs to attempt to decrypt each and every output description on the Iron Fish chain, and keep the ones where decryption was successful (an unsuccessful decryption would cause the Poly1305 MAC verification to fail). The operation of searching for received notes by decrypting all transactions is called **scanning**.

This works due to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange property. Both the sender and recipient are able to independently compute the **same** shared secret from publicly available information.

<img src="/images/whitepaper/protocol/accounts/encryption.svg" width="65%" style={{marginBottom: '2em'}}/>

**Using the sender’s outgoing view key**

After the transaction is constructed and transmitted, the sender would need access to the **esk** that was used for encrypting the Note in order to decrypt it later on for accurate transaction history. The **esk** is saved in its encrypted form as part of $C^{out}$ encrypted blob on the Outgoing Description. It’s encrypted using an **encryption key** that’s computed as

```jsx
encryption_key = blake2(personalization: SHARED_KEY_PERSONALIZATION, ovk_sender || cv || cm || epk)
```

The **esk** is then encrypted using the **encryption key** and ChaCha20-Poly1305 as $C^{out}$ on the Output Description. The sender’s wallet can therefore get access to outgoing transaction details using publicly available information on the Output Description and sender’s outgoing view key (see [Accounts](/learn/whitepaper/protocol/accounts) for description of key components).

## Walkthrough of common scenarios

The transaction descriptions described above may be combined to construct transactions to perform various actions. The most basic actions are described below, but please note that a transaction may contain an arbitrary combination of descriptions (as long as the balance equation is respected), and as such multiple actions may be included in the same transaction.

#### Sending Tokens

An Iron Fish account may send tokens of an asset to another account by creating a transaction with one or more spend descriptions (each containing one note to consume), and one or more output descriptions (each containing one new note).

When sending tokens of the native asset (\$IRON), the difference between the spend description values and the output description values is the transaction fee.

When sending tokens of any other asset, the sum of the spend description values must equal the sum of the output description values.

#### Minting

Minting (increasing the supply of an asset) can be done by creating a transaction with one or more mint descriptions, and one or more output descriptions (each containing one new note).

The output descriptions allow sending the newly minted tokens to arbitrary accounts.

The sum of the values of the mint descriptions must equal the sum of the value of the output descriptions.

#### Burning

Burning (decreasing the supply of an asset) can be done by creating a transaction with one or more spend descriptions (each containing one note to destroy), and one or more burn descriptions.

The sum of the values of the spend descriptions must equal the sum of the value of the burn descriptions.

It follows that an account may only burn tokens that they own in the form of notes. In particular, the owner of an asset may not burn the asset if they do not own any token of that asset.

#### Asset creation

Asset creation is a special case of [minting](#mint-description). In order to create a new asset, an account may simply mint a non-zero amount of it.

#### Changing asset ownership

Changing the ownership of an asset can be done by creating a transaction with a [mint description](#mint-description), by setting the dedicated field of the mint description to the new owner account address.
