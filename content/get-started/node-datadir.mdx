## Data structure

By default, the database and configuration files for the Iron Fish node are created in the `~/.ironfish` directory.

The file structure is composed of the following:

```sh
[Iron Fish Node]
├── config.json
├── internal.json
└── databases
...└── chain
...└── wallet
```

You can change the working directory by passing the flag `--datadir` when running a command. Doing so will require you to sync the node again with the network.

Configuration files can be edited by the commands described [here](/use/get-started/cli-cmd-config-set).
