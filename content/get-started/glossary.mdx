This will teach you about the basic concepts of Iron Fish. If you want to see more advanced information, see our [developer glossary](/developers/documentation/glossary).


## Block

A block is a verified collection of transactions. When a [#miner] creates a block with transactions, the miner is saying, "this batch of transactions are valid and follow the rules". When a block is created and accepted to the network, all nodes will accept these transactions as valid.

Blocks are connected together by each block knowing
If a bad actor miner creates a block with invalid transactions, the block will not be accepted by other nodes.

## Difficulty

### Sequence

The sequential index number of a block in the Iron Fish chain, or the number of blocks up to and including the current block.

## Wallet

An Iron Fish wallet manages [Accounts](#account), listens to incoming transactions from the chain, and broadcasts transactions to the chain.

### Account

An Iron Fish account holds private [keys](#keys) which enable users to view transaction details and transfer assets to other addresses.

### View Key

A composite of the [Outgoing View Key](#outgoing-view-key) and [Incoming View Key](#incoming-view-key) allowing for note decryption from both outgoing and incoming transactions.

## Transaction

A collection of actions (ex. transfer of an [Asset](#asset) between two parties, burning supply of an [Asset](#asset), etc.) that is persisted and verified on a blockchain.

The total value of a transaction balances to 0 by the following:
```
sum(spends) + sum(mints) - sum(outputs) - sum(burns) - transaction_fee = 0
```

## Note

The basic unit to represent value of any asset type on the Iron Fish chain. Always stored in its encrypted format publicly. Contains the owner address, original sender address, value, memo, and [Asset Generator](#asset-generator).

## Nullifier

A 32 byte hash that when revealed marks a note as spent so that note cannot be spent again.

## Asset

A user-created resource which can be transferred privately, minted, and burned. Contains metadata, a name, the owner public address, and nonce.

### Transaction Fee

A reward in $IRON which is paid out to miners for confirming [Transactions](#transaction) to a [Block](#block).

Nodes that propose a new block to be added to the blockchain to other nodes.

## Miner

Core mechanism that defines by which rules new [Blocks](#block) are created and by which rules a peer can verify and accept an incoming [Blocks](#block).
