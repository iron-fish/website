## Node
The node can have the following status:

| Status       | Description                                                                                                  |
| :-----------:| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| STARTED      | Node is running                                                                                              |
| STOPPED      | Node is not running. Start it with `ironfish start`                                                          |
| ERROR        | An error occured while running the node. Run `ironfish logs -v` to see the latest error messages             |

## Node Name

This is the publically visible node name that your peers will see when you connect to them.

By default, no node name is set. You can set a node name by using

```sh
ironfish config:set nodeName "My Node"
```

## Peer ID

This is your P2P network ID. It's consistent between network runs, and is used to identify you among your peers. It's primary function is to also help route messages to you through the network.

If you want to generate a new Peer ID you can pass `--generateNewIdentity` to `start`

```sh
ironfish start --generateNewIdentity
```

## Block Graffiti

This is your personal message that you attach to every block that you mine.

```sh
ironfish config:set blockGraffiti "Hello World"
```

## Network

This is the network you are connected to.

## Memory

This represents the memory usage of your node.

 - Heap: Node memory used by Javascript
 - RSS: Resident Set
 - Free: How much free memory there is left on your computer

## CPU

Information about the CPU the node is running on including cores and current CPU usage.

## Mining

Information about mining on your node. If you have no miners connected to your node, it will show 0 miners.

## Mem Pool

This this information about your pending transactioins and it's total size. Evictions are how many invalid transactions have been evicted and will not be mined.

## Syncer
The block syncer is the system decides to download chains from peers on the network.

The syncer can have the following status:

| Status          | Description                                                                                               |
| :--------------:| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| IDLE            | The syncer is paused -  your chain is synced with the network                                             |
| REQUESTING      | The syncer is requesting blocks from the network                                                          |
| SYNCING         | The syncer is currently adding blocks to your local chain                                                 |
| STOPPED         | The syncer is stopped - either because you are not connected to the network, or your node is not running  |

## Workers
Workers show information about the worker pool which are light processes that can execut asynchronous jobs for the node.

## Blockchain
Blockchain head indicates the head of your chain on your local node. It changes every 60 seconds.

### Chain information

Run the following command to display your chain status. Heaviest head is the latest block synced to the genesis block in your chain. Latest head is the latest block received from a peer in the Iron Fish network.

<Terminal
  command="ironfish chain:show"
  output={`\
