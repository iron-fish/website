> **Note:** Our Homebrew tap does not yet support **Apple Silicon/arm64**. We recommend installing Iron Fish [using NPM](/use/get-started/installation#install-or-update-iron-fish-win-mac). You can also install Iron Fish [from the source](#from-source) or [use Docker](#using-docker) with `x86_64` support.

## Installing

Start by [installing Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and install from [custom tap](https://github.com/iron-fish/homebrew-brew):

```sh
brew tap iron-fish/brew && brew install ironfish
```

To verify your CLI installation, use the ironfish --version command.

```sh
$ ironfish --version
name       ironfish
version    1.7.0
git        b240df1
runtime    node/18.12.1
```

```sh
brew install ironfish
```

brew uninstall ironfish
```
