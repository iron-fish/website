> **Note:** Docker is for advanced users and not recommended.

## Install

Install by downloading the docker image.
```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/iron-fish/ironfish:latest
```

To verify your CLI installation, use this command

```sh
docker run --rm --tty --interactive ghcr.io/iron-fish/ironfish:latest --version
```

### Updating

To update your image, use `docker pull` and then start your container:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/iron-fish/ironfish:latest
```

Optionally you can use tools like [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) which is a process for automating Docker container base image updates.

### Uninstall

```sh
docker rmi ghcr.io/iron-fish/ironfish:latest
```

### Using Docker

Run the Docker image from the GitHub registry, mounting the node's data directory into your home directory and using the host network.

> **Note:** Replace `<home-directory>` with `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows or `$HOME` on others

```sh
docker run --rm --tty --interactive --network host --volume <home-directory>/.ironfish:/root/.ironfish ghcr.io/iron-fish/ironfish:latest
```

Now check the status of your node using IPC, again replacing `<home-directory>` according to your OS.

```sh
docker run --rm --tty --interactive --network host --volume <home-directory>/.ironfish:/root/.ironfish ghcr.io/iron-fish/ironfish:latest status -f
```

**Note:** `--network host` is needed for 2 Docker containers to connect over IPC.

**Note:** You can also use the RPC layer over TCP by starting your node with `--rpc.tcp`, which connects over the default port 8020.
