Miners are essential to the health of the Iron Fish network. Without them, blocks won't be generated and transactions won't be transmitted.

It's also the key algorithm used to determine consensus and is important to be distributed among many different sets of miners. If any one miner controls too much of the mining power, it will compromise decentralization.

This page primarily discusses the mining landscape and how to join and choose an existing pool, or to start your own.

## What is a mining pool?

A mining pool pools block rewards and distributes them via various reward distribution schemes such as PPLNS (PAY PER LAST N SHARES). As Iron Fish blocks are mined every 60 seconds, it is unlikely that small miners find rewards after mainnet launches. Pools provide a steady income in return for a fee. They may also provide other services such as customer support or custom software. Pools also run the node for you so that you do not need to maintain your own.

Please check out the pools websites for instructions on how to join that pool.

⚠️️ **Note:** Any pool with greater than 45% hash rate is hidden from this list. Please do not join a mining pool that has more than 45% hash rate. It is very important to promote decentralization.
