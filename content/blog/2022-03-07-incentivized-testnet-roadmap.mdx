Hello Iron Fishers! 👋

Thank you to everyone for helping us continuously test and improve Iron Fish 🙏. Since we launched the [incentivized testnet](https://testnet.ironfish.network/about) in December we’ve had over 9k participants with points on the [leaderboard](https://testnet.ironfish.network/leaderboard). Miners, open source developers, artists 👩‍🎨, bloggers, translators and many others all around the world helped us improve and spread the word about Iron Fish.

We’re building Iron Fish to be the universal privacy layer for crypto—a true SSL layer for blockchains. We believe the first step towards that goal is to build a solid foundation of shipping an easy-to-use, privacy-first layer 1 blockchain. Our plan is to launch Iron Fish mainnet with the core functionalities of private transactions it has today, and upgrade it over time to achieve our mission of providing privacy to all crypto assets.

## Incentivized Testnet Phase 1

The first Iron Fish incentivized testnet was launched on December 1st. Since then, people from 156 countries have signed up, more than 18k people joined our Discord, and close to 9k participants have contributed in some way to Iron Fish. We closed close to 300 GitHub issues in that timeframe as well as numerous features and open source contributions. The Iron Fish full node implementation improved immensely, and we learned a ton from our community.

**We are officially ending the first Iron Fish incentivized testnet at block 150,000 (approximately on Friday March 11th)**. All participants will be emailed in the next few weeks regarding next steps. [Sign up here](https://ironfish.network/#email-signup) if you haven’t already to stay in the loop

## Incentivized Testnet Phase 2

**The subsequent incentivized testnet Phase 2 will be announced in a few weeks with different rules**. This second testnet will run up until mainnet launch, with the goal of stress-testing and preparing Iron Fish for mainnet. Stay tuned for more updates!

Thank you all for participating. You all have made the Iron Fish network and community truly special 🙏.
