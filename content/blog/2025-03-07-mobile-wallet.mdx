While corporations and financial institutions profit from tracking your every transaction, we've been building something different. Today, we're taking one step closer towards giving financial freedom back to the people with the initial release of [Iron Fish Mobile App on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/TNWjNZ72 ) ‚Äî the first truly private stablecoin experience that fits in your pocket. What Venmo did for convenience, Iron Fish does for privacy.

### USDC + best privacy crypto can offer

You pay for therapy sessions, support family overseas, or make legal but sensitive purchases‚Äîand all of it is permanently recorded, analyzed, and most usually shared. Your financial life becomes an open book for advertisers, data brokers, and anyone who gains access to these databases.

And unfortunately, crypto as it is today, is even *more* transparent with powerful tools that track and label your every move:

We wanted to give our users the ability to pay for every day goods and services directly from their phone, in a completely private way. **True digital cash.**

With the Iron Fish Mobile App now you can:

- **Send private transactions** with the same ease as Venmo or Cash App
- **Bidirectionally bridge USDC from Base** into a truly confidential environment
- **View your history** without worrying who else might be watching
- **Control your financial identity** without sacrificing convenience

The future is crypto, and that future is private.

### Stablecoin + Privacy = üî•

The numbers tell a compelling story: in 2024, stablecoin transaction volume exceeded \$27trillion, surpassing the combined volumes of Visa and Mastercard. Stripe's recent \$1B acquisition of Bridge.xyz confirms what many already know: stablecoins are crypto's killer app.

But there's been a missing piece: privacy.

Our ChainPort integration now connects Iron Fish to 27+ transparent chains, with USDC from Base as our flagship bridged asset. This infrastructure enables something truly special: a multi-asset privacy pool for many assets across many chains across many ecosystems.

### Responsible Privacy By Design

Privacy doesn't mean lawlessness. We've designed our system with responsibility in mind. Every bridge transaction transferring USDC to or from Iron Fish must pass a sanctions screening test, powered by ChainPort.

This reflects our philosophy: everyone deserves financial privacy, but we can implement it responsibly. Just as encrypted messaging protects legitimate conversations while still allowing for appropriate legal processes, private financial systems can balance individual rights with societal obligations.

### Leveraging the Community for Technical Breakthrough

_"A mobile app for a privacy chain will never have a good user experience."_

_"Sync times are going to kill any adoption."_

_‚ÄúDecrypting every transaction just to see your balance? Never gonna happen‚Äù_

That's what conventional wisdom said‚Äîand for good reason. Privacy blockchains face a fundamental challenge: since all balances are encrypted, your wallet typically needs to download and process the entire chain, a resource-intensive task that's impractical on mobile devices. Traditional transparent chains like Ethereum solve this by using centralized node providers like Infura or Alchemy, but that option isn't available when privacy is your core feature.

The Iron Fish Mobile App uses the same backend infrastructure that powers Oreowallet (a community grant project), which is hosted and maintained by the Oreowallet team. Just as we implemented Fish Hash‚Äîa community-created, GPU-friendly, and ASIC-resistant hashing algorithm‚Äîthrough our first hardfork, this collaboration exemplifies how we build: finding brilliant community members, supporting their vision with resources, and integrating their innovations into the core ecosystem.

With a collaboration with Oreowallet we landed on an architecture such that:

1. Your device generates and securely stores your private keys that never leave the device ‚Äî achieving a safe user experience
2. A view key (not your secret spending key) is provided to a specialized server hosted by Oreowallet
3. This server handles the heavy computational work of scanning and decrypting transactions giving the end user the performance of beefy server on their mobile device ‚Äî achieving much faster sync times than if it were on-device alone üôå
4. The result is sent back to your phone and only *your device* can initiate moving funds
