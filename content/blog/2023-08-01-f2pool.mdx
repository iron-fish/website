In today’s community spotlight, we are thrilled to highlight [F2Pool](https://www.f2pool.com/), one of the leading mining pools on Iron Fish.

Founded in 2013 by Chun and DiscusFish, it began its journey as a Bitcoin and Litecoin mining pool and quickly became the leading mining pool in Asia.

Since then, F2Pool has grown to become a globally recognized brand that supports miners in over 100 countries mining on over 20 PoW networks, including Iron Fish. With over ten years of operation, F2Pool has mined more than 1.2 million BTC.

## Why F2Pool?

They credit their success to their commitment to core values, a constant push for innovation, and the provision of world-leading mining pool services to miners. This includes a track record of mining the most Bitcoin blocks, providing stable mining services with low latency rates, offering transparency in rewards, and providing regular, stable payouts. With a focus on superior customer service and support for global communities, F2Pool has positioned itself as a trusted partner for both large-scale mining operations and individual miners alike.

F2Pool offers great features with their easy-to-use logged-in mining, including subaccounts, multi-platform offline alerts, payout configurations, and more through their website and app. They’re also active promoters of green energy mining 🙌.

Everything F2Pool does to support their miners is meticulous and thoughtful. Before releasing support for Iron Fish they thoroughly tested their pool to ensure connectivity, proper payouts, and accurate information on their website. 

Since mainnet, their “*pool has been running stably and attracting more and more miners, making F2Pool one of the top Iron Fish pools.” —Red Luo, Content Manager at F2Pool*

“*We are happy to build the Iron Fish ecosystem together!”* and so are we :)

## F2Pool + Iron Fish

Since the launch of the Iron Fish mainnet on April 20th, F2Pool has been at the forefront of our mining community.

*“We find Iron Fish to be an appealing blockchain project due to its focus on privacy, security, and decentralization. The use of zero-knowledge proofs to encrypt transactions and protect users’ privacy is a significant advantage in a world where data breaches and hacks are becoming increasingly common. The fact that Iron Fish is built on Proof-of-Work consensus is also noteworthy, as it allows for a more decentralized network and provides an opportunity for the mining community to be involved.” —Red Luo, Content Manager at F2Pool*

By providing an Iron Fish mining pool, F2Pool helps miners contribute to the decentralization of Iron Fish and offers their mining community a chance to participate in the Iron Fish ecosystem.

They’ve also engaged Iron Fish protocol developers and community members by sharing insights on the Iron Fish network, latest mining hardware, hashrate changes, and more to keep everyone informed.

“*A thriving mining community will undoubtedly be a strong support for the entire Iron Fish ecosystem”* and we couldn’t agree more.

## Why Iron Fish

What excited F2Pool about Iron Fish is “*the development potential and demand for a crypto privacy protocol in the web3 space.”* Specifically, they’re excited to see cross-chain wallets for private assets, marketplaces for private assets, and applications in areas such as DeFi and NFTs where privacy can bring great value to the end user.

“*What excites us about the future of Iron Fish is the potential for more people to discover the value and benefits of the technology. Witnessing the combination of ZK with PoW consensus is a great thing to expect. We believe that the network’s focus on privacy and security will continue to attract users, and the community-driven approach would make it an attractive option for both experienced and new users.”—Red Luo, Content Manager at F2Pool*
