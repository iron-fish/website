## F2Pool + Iron Fish

Since the launch of the Iron Fish mainnet on April 20th, F2Pool has been at the forefront of our mining community.

*‚ÄúWe find Iron Fish to be an appealing blockchain project due to its focus on privacy, security, and decentralization. The use of zero-knowledge proofs to encrypt transactions and protect users‚Äô privacy is a significant advantage in a world where data breaches and hacks are becoming increasingly common. The fact that Iron Fish is built on Proof-of-Work consensus is also noteworthy, as it allows for a more decentralized network and provides an opportunity for the mining community to be involved.‚Äù ‚ÄîRed Luo, Content Manager at F2Pool*

By providing an Iron Fish mining pool, F2Pool helps miners contribute to the decentralization of Iron Fish and offers their mining community a chance to participate in the Iron Fish ecosystem.

They‚Äôve also engaged Iron Fish protocol developers and community members by sharing insights on the Iron Fish network, latest mining hardware, hashrate changes, and more to keep everyone informed.

‚Äú*A thriving mining community will undoubtedly be a strong support for the entire Iron Fish ecosystem‚Äù* and we couldn‚Äôt agree more.

## Why Iron Fish

What excited F2Pool about Iron Fish is ‚Äú*the development potential and demand for a crypto privacy protocol in the web3 space.‚Äù* Specifically, they‚Äôre excited to see cross-chain wallets for private assets, marketplaces for private assets, and applications in areas such as DeFi and NFTs where privacy can bring great value to the end user.

‚Äú*What excites us about the future of Iron Fish is the potential for more people to discover the value and benefits of the technology. Witnessing the combination of ZK with PoW consensus is a great thing to expect. We believe that the network‚Äôs focus on privacy and security will continue to attract users, and the community-driven approach would make it an attractive option for both experienced and new users.‚Äù‚ÄîRed Luo, Content Manager at F2Pool*
