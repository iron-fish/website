## Iron Fish Foundation

The Iron Fish Foundation is dedicated to making web3 safe through privacy. Our mission is to bring privacy to crypto by growing the Iron Fish ecosystem and establishing it as the go-to privacy platform for all cryptocurrencies.

We collaborate with community members and organizations to accelerate the Iron Fish ecosystem's growth through developer grants, ecosystem grants, events, partnerships, education, resources, and much more!

## Iron Fish Grants Program

Our Grants Program plays an important role in our mission to fund builders and creators who are dedicated to bringing privacy to all crypto assets with Iron Fish. We prioritize projects that enhance user experience, interoperability, and generally expand use cases for Iron Fish.

Anyone who has an idea on improving Iron Fish or its ecosystem in any way is welcome to apply! Currently, we are focused on funding projects that prioritize bridging Iron Fish to other L1s/L2s/L3s, optimize performance of Iron Fish or Iron Fish wallets, or are working on educational efforts about anything Iron Fish related. 

Weâ€™ve received numerous grant applications and reviewed all serious entries. The developer grants chosen for funding by the Iron Fish Foundation (as of this blog post date), based on their impact and background, are the following:
