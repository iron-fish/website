In our latest ecosystem spotlight, we’re excited to highlight **HeroMiners**. 

HeroMiners is one of the top mining pools for Iron Fish. They have consistently been a strong supporter of the project, and a loud voice in our community. They stand out not only because they’ve been the top identified mining pool for Iron Fish since mainnet, but also for publicly sharing their deep industry expertise in mining to the Iron Fish community and establishing themselves as a trusted voice. 

Since mainnet launch have created tons of resources, videos, and guides to educate the ecosystem on how to mine Iron Fish. Many miners have first heard of Iron Fish and started to mine Iron Fish because of them. 

We had the opportunity to delve into a Q&A with HeroMiners to understand their passion for privacy and their commitment to the crypto community:

##### **Who is HeroMiners?**
Born amidst the crypto buzz of late 2017 and early 2018, HeroMiners delved into the mining industry and decided to build a mining pool service that was better and more transparent to miners. "We started to understand how pools work and we thought we could do better. That's why we decided to set up our own pool," they explained.

##### **Why HeroMiners is Different**
Unlike traditional mining pools, HeroMiners emphasizes transparency and detailed metrics. "We started with mining and are progressing in the mining industry. It's a classic phrase, but we're one of you. We share metrics with miners that many pools do not have. You can see many details down to the smallest detail in the pool. Especially with the stream feature, you can easily understand what is going on."

##### **A Strong Presence in the Iron Fish Community**
HeroMiners was quick to recognize the potential of Iron Fish and its innovative technology. They launched their Iron Fish mining pool on March 11th in anticipation of original (delayed) mainnet date of March 14th. Despite mainnet delay, they were pivotal in the early days of Iron Fish. Notably, HeroMiners was responsible for discovering the [first Iron Fish blocks](https://twitter.com/HeroMinerss/status/1649136121685655554). Their proactive nature and commitment to optimization made them rise as one of the most efficient pools with the lowest orphan rate.

They also had a lot of firsts: “We were one of the first pools to be ready for mainnet. We were the first to make use of the 3-4x hashrate improvement with SRBMiner. We were the first pool to support exchange mining for miners who were not comfortable with the CLI wallet.”

When asked why they chose Iron Fish, the answer was clear: "Because you have an innovative approach. There has never been a mineable layer-1 coin with ZkSnark technology promising what you promise. This caught our attention."

##### **An Advocate for Privacy**
For HeroMiners, the importance of privacy is not confined to the realms of cryptocurrency. "It has to be in every aspect of life, not just crypto. Everyone is watching us, but they don't like it when we try to hide ourselves," they voiced. When we asked what are the major areas for privacy that you are excited about, they answered “****************************************Every. Single. One.”**************************************** From bank transactions to medical confidentiality and personal ID, HeroMiners believes that every individual has the inherent right to privacy.

##### **The Future with Iron Fish**
With a strong commitment to progressing privacy in all sectors and an undying passion for mining, HeroMiners continues to be one of the strongest supporters of Iron Fish. Their journey serves as a testament to the changing winds in the crypto world, where privacy isn't just an option – it's a necessity.
