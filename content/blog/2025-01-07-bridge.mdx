Today marks a huge step for blockchain privacy: Iron Fish has partnered with ChainPort to enable seamless private transactions across 20+ EVM chains, including Ethereum, Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum.

For the first time, private USDC is now available on Iron Fish, offering users the ability to transact stablecoins privately while maintaining compliance and security.

## A Universal Privacy Layer for Crypto

Our vision for Iron Fish has always been to provide every crypto asset with access to a safe privacy layer. Today, we‚Äôre taking a significant step toward realizing that vision by launching the infrastructure to make Iron Fish the universal privacy layer for all assets on all chains.

## Introducing Private Wrapped USDC on Iron Fish

Stablecoins are one of the top killer use cases for crypto. However, their usage at scale has been hindered by the transparent nature of public blockchains which exposes all transaction details.

With Iron Fish, private USDC transactions are now possible, combining the stability of USDC with the privacy users demand. This opens doors for real-world payment use cases like payroll, invoices, payments, donations, cross-border remittances, and more‚Äîall with the assurance of privacy and compliance.

## Optional Privacy to 20+ EVM Chains

With this partnership, Iron Fish brings optional privacy to virtually any asset:

**1. Enhanced Privacy Across Chains:** Verified assets from 20+ EVM-compatible chains can now be transacted privately on Iron Fish through ChainPort.

**2. Private USDC Transactions:** Users can now wrap and transact USDC privately, unlocking a secure, real-world use case for stablecoins.

**3. Wrapped IRON Expansion:** The wrapped IRON token is available on Ethereum, Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum, expanding Iron Fish‚Äôs cross-chain presence.

**4. AI-Driven Sanctions Screening:** ChainPort employs real-time threat detection and advanced analytics to ensure that only clean funds enter the Iron Fish network.

## A Safe and Compliant Privacy Layer

ChainPort ensures that privacy doesn‚Äôt compromise compliance. Their advanced sanctions screening and real-time threat detection provide:

**‚Ä¢ Exclusion List:** Dynamically updated to block wallets associated with malicious activity.

**‚Ä¢ Real-Time Monitoring:** Detects suspicious behavior and prevents illicit funds from entering the Iron Fish network.

**‚Ä¢ Compliance Leadership:** ChainPort sets a new standard for regulatory compliance in the blockchain ecosystem.

> Eitan Lavi, co-founder of Dcentralab (developer of ChainPort), stated: ‚ÄúThis integration with Iron Fish is a game-changer. It enhances privacy and security across multiple chains while setting new benchmarks for compliance.‚Äù

## Privacy Has Never Been More Important in the Age of AI

AI is going to be one of the biggest shifts for humanity in the next few years, and privacy has never been more important. AI agents can sift through vast amounts of information and chain data to build extensive data profiles on individuals, organizations and even other AI agents. By providing a sanctuary of privacy, Iron Fish ensures that personal and business data stays confidential and financial data stays private making your on-chain actions future proof against growing AI capabilities.

Stay tuned as we expand our partnerships with DeFi, DePIN, and social verticals on EVM chains, and work with innovative projects.
