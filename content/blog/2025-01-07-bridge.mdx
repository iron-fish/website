Today, we’re excited to launch a project we started nearly a year ago, building upon a vision that has been in the works for much longer. This launch represents a major milestone and the culmination of efforts from the Iron Fish Foundation, IF Labs, [Dcentralab](https://www.dcentralab.com/) (for ChainPort bridge integration), [Zondax](https://zondax.ch/) (for Ledger integration), [oreoslabs](https://github.com/oreoslabs) (for Oreowallet browser wallet implementation), and the many community members who contributed along the way.
### A Universal Privacy Layer for Crypto

Our vision for Iron Fish has always been to provide every crypto asset with access to a safe privacy layer. Today, we’re taking a significant step toward realizing that vision by launching the infrastructure to make Iron Fish the universal privacy layer for all assets on all chains.

### Launching the ChainPort Iron Fish Bridge Integration

Today we’re launching our ChainPort bridge integration making Iron Fish’s privacy layer accessible to over 20 transparent chains such as Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Ethereum, and more, granting these networks access to the largest cross-chain anonymity set available. We’ll continue collaborating with ChainPort to add more assets, ensuring a seamless user experience and further expanding privacy options across the crypto landscape.

### Introducing Private Wrapped USDC on Iron Fish

We believe stablecoins represent one of crypto’s most compelling use cases, particularly for payments. As a result, the very first asset we’ll be supporting through this integration is USDC. Users can now bidirectionally bridge USDC from any supported chain to Iron Fish and receive fully private wrapped USDC.

This capability unlocks a wide range of use cases—such as payroll, payments, invoices, donations, or any other scenario where protecting sensitive transaction details is important. 

### A Safe and Compliant Privacy Layer

ChainPort ensures that enhanced privacy does not compromise security or compliance. Its advanced sanctions screening and real-time threat detection provide:

* Exclusion List: Dynamically updated to block wallets associated with malicious activity.
* Real-Time Monitoring: Detects suspicious behavior and prevents illicit funds from entering the Iron Fish network.
* Compliance Leadership: Sets a new standard for regulatory compliance in the blockchain ecosystem.

> “This integration with Iron Fish is a game-changer,” says Eitan Lavi, co-founder of Dcentralab (developer of ChainPort). “It enhances privacy and security across multiple chains while setting new benchmarks for compliance.”

###  Privacy Has Never Been More Important in the Age of AI

AI is going to be one of the biggest shifts for humanity in the next few years, and privacy has never been more important. AI agents can sift through vast amounts of information, including financial records, to build extensive data profiles on individuals, organizations and even other AI agents. By embracing a privacy-first approach, Iron Fish helps ensure that:

* Personal and Business Data Stay Confidential: Prevent data harvesting by AI-driven analytics tools.
* Financial Autonomy Remains Uncompromised: Avoid inadvertent disclosures that could lead to unfair profiling or security risks.
* Secure Cross-Chain Innovation: Even as AI-driven crypto solutions expand, Iron Fish provides the crucial privacy foundation that lets innovation flourish without exposing sensitive details.
* Future-Proof Against Growing AI Capabilities: As AI systems become more powerful, so does their ability to correlate transaction data. Iron Fish ensures that your financial activities remain protected in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
