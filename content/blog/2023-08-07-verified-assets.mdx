Recently we’ve rolled out the Verified Assets feature in the Iron Fish wallet CLI (v1.6.0). The Verified Assets feature is intended to increase security and user confidence when using custom assets on Iron Fish.

If you’ve been around in crypto for a little while, you know that there are countless tokens out there that share the same token tickers. A small misstep can cause users to accidentally swap with, trade, or add to their wallets tokens that *look* like the right asset but could really be malicious attempts to scam users out of their funds.

Today, many wallets have guardrails in place to protect users from this risk. Wallets will typically warn users if an asset isn’t known, or has been identified as an outright scam. Iron Fish’s Verified Assets feature achieves this similar protection, letting Iron Fish users know when they’re interacting with a verified asset. 

For example, if you’re on the latest version of the CLI, you should see a green check mark by the IRON ticker indicating that this wallet has verified IRON tokens.

**Verified Assets Selection**

Currently, IF Labs and the Iron Fish Foundation manually update a list of verified assets. This process is done in preparation for the bridge that is coming up on the Iron Fish roadmap — which will support wrapped assets brought to Iron Fish from other chains. Verified Assets will help Iron Fish users confidently interact with private multi-asset transfers.

In the future, verified assets will be managed by the Iron Fish community. Recognizing verified assets are the responsibility of wallet providers, and we hope that other Iron Fish wallet providers in the future will maintain the same list as the Iron Fish Foundation in order to protect their users.
