Anej first joined the Iron Fish Discord server when there were under 1000 members. With that server now at over 50k (and growing!), Anej is definitely an Iron Fish early user. Scroll down to hear Anej's crypto origin story, future crypto predictions, and what drew them to Iron Fish in the first place.

### Tell us a bit about yourself.

Hi there, my name is Anej and I am from Slovenia where I work for a non-traditional IT company. Outside of work, I'm an avid cyclist and love spending my free time exploring the beautiful countryside.

### How did you get into crypto?

I got into crypto in early 2014, right after the first major Bitcoin pump. Initially, I was just curious about digital currencies and how they worked. Buying my first Bitcoin was a bit of a challenge, but I found an exchange that accepted Minecraft Linden dollars. That was the easiest way for me to get my hands on some BTC. I vividly remember my first trade on Mintpal exchange when Blackcoin saw a massive 300x increase just a few days after I bought it. In retrospect, I wish I had sold at that point, but the experience only fueled my interest in trading and the crypto space as a whole.

### What do you wish you could do with crypto that you can't right now?

Another feature that I wish crypto had, in addition to more seamless transactions, is enhanced privacy. Currently, most crypto transactions are recorded on a public ledger that can be viewed by anyone, which means that anyone can potentially see what I purchased and where I purchased it from. This lack of privacy can be a major concern for some users, especially if they want to keep their purchases discreet. If crypto could offer a more private way to conduct transactions, it would be a game-changer. Imagine being able to use your crypto wallet to buy a cheeseburger or pizza without anyone being able to see the transaction details.

### What do you think will drive crypto adoption?

I believe that clear regulatory frameworks will be a key driver for crypto adoption in the long run. While there are certainly benefits to decentralization and independence from government oversight, the lack of clear regulations has led to uncertainty and hesitation among many potential users and investors.

### When did you learn about Iron Fish, and what sparked your interest in Iron Fish specifically?

I first learned about Iron Fish while browsing through investment rounds. What sparked my interest in it was its unique and eye-catching logo.

After doing some research, I decided to join the Iron Fish Discord community to learn more about the project and its potential. The project was still a bit early, but I was intrigued by the idea of a privacy-focused blockchain platform that was easy to use and accessible to everyone. I even tried running a node and mining on my laptop, which was a great experience and helped me gain a better understanding of how the platform works. 

Since then, I've been following the latest developments and updates from the Iron Fish team and continue to be impressed by the progress they're making in creating a more private, secure, and user-friendly blockchain platform.

### How do you explain Iron Fish to someone who is just beginning to learn about the project?

Iron Fish is a blockchain project that is focused on privacy, security, and accessibility. It has huge potential to become a leading platform in the crypto space in terms of privacy layer, and being here from the start has been a humble experience watching its development. What makes Iron Fish stand out is its user-friendly approach to blockchain technology. With just a few commands anyone can run a full node and ensure their transactions are kept private and secure.

### What has been your experience with the Iron Fish community?

Very positive! It's a very friendly and supportive community where people are always willing to help each other out.When I first joined the Iron Fish Discord server, there were probably less than 1000 members. Now, the community has grown to more than 50k members, which is great to see. It's especially impressive to see this growth happening organically, without the use of fake members or other tactics that some projects use to boost their servers.

### What do you think draws others to Iron Fish?

I think there are a few things that draw people to Iron Fish. Firstly, the incentivized testnet has been a great way to build recognition and generate interest in the project. It has been a great way for people to get involved in the project, test out the platform, and earn some rewards while doing so. Another factor is the ZK-SNARK technology that Iron Fish is built on. This is a cutting-edge privacy technology that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of transactions on the blockchain.

### What has your experience been like interacting with Iron Fish team members?

The developer team is probably the most accessible team I've encountered in the blockchain space. You can always interact with them on Discord, and they're always willing to help out with any questions or concerns you might have. I hope  they got some sleep after  putting in long hours to make sure everything is perfect for the community. I think they deserve some vacations for sure!

### What makes Iron Fish different from other crypto projects you've dealt with?

By leading with regulatory compliance, I think it occupies a unique position in the realm of privacy layer coins. While it provides users with full privacy, it also ensures that it complies with regulations and laws related to cryptocurrency. This is a significant departure from many other privacy coins.

### Is there anything else that you'd like to share?

I want to give a special shout-out to [ProductGuy](https://ironfish.network/learn/blog/2023-02-10-community-spotlight-productguy) (you are a machine!), [null](https://ironfish.network/learn/blog/2023-03-29-community-spotlight-null), wd021, fishguy and all the other community members who have been actively participating and contributing to the discussions. I also want to shout-out all the new members who have recently joined the mining community. It's fantastic to see the mining community being so inclusive and respectful.
