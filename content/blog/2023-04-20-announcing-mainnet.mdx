### We’re thrilled to announce that the Iron Fish Mainnet is LIVE!! 🎉 🎉

Iron Fish is the privacy platform for web3. Our vision is to make web3 safe through privacy while deterring bad actors, and our mission is for Iron Fish to be the privacy platform for all crypto transactions. Mainnet is a huge step towards this future.

As a fully encrypted, layer-1 blockchain, Iron Fish uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to protect users’ personal data. Compliance is built-in — every Iron Fish account also comes with a set of view keys allowing them to provide read-only access to their transaction records as necessary.

## Encryption for all

Iron Fish has been built with accessibility in mind. Anyone can install Iron Fish with one line in the terminal — npm install -g ironfish . We’ve frequently heard from users in Discord that Iron Fish was their first experience with the command line. Keep an eye out for our [upcoming GUI wallet](https://www.ironfish.network/use/node-app), making usage even simpler.

Everyone in the world can:

-   host a node
-   start mining
-   mint/burn custom assets
-   transfer assets

If you’re interested in mining, check out our day-1 [mining guide](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/wiki/Iron-Fish-Launch-Day-Mining).

## Community

We believe in the power of community. With a focus on open source tools, clear onboarding, and welcoming gathering spaces, more people can join in.

Iron Fish community members have shown they’re here to stay. Our testnet processed over 50m transactions — all shielded using zero-knowledge proofs, making Iron Fish one of the largest processor of ZKPs ever. Our Phase 3 of the Incentivized Testnet had over 60k  concurrent nodes online.

## What’s next?

The need for privacy isn’t going anywhere. We will keep building and breaking records — stretching the possibilities of what crypto can do. Stay tuned for more information on our next steps and, in the meantime, [it's time for mainnet](https://www.ironfish.network/use/get-started/installation)!
