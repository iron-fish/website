The [Iron Fish Grants Program](https://ironfish.network/learn/blog/2023-07-24-grants) is supporting the growing ecosystem of projects building with Iron Fish’s privacy technology. Today, we’re shining a spotlight on one of the first recipients of an Iron Fish Grant — **Orya**!

Orya is an NFT launchpad with a set of related projects, all aimed at bringing an ecosystem of private non-fungible assets to the Iron Fish network. The Orya project is part of an ambitious effort to develop “Orescriptions,” a protocol for NFTs that use Iron Fish as their privacy layer.

The Orya team has also developed a privacy-preserving block explorer called [Oreoscan](https://www.oreoscan.info/en), which we [highlighted](https://ironfish.network/learn/blog/2023-07-11-community-spotlight-oreoscan) in a recent ecosystem blog post. We caught up with the Orya team to highlight this new project and share it with the community.

##### **What does Orya do? What is your vision for Orya?**

"Orya is an NFT launchpad on the Iron Fish blockchain network. Inspired by Bitcoin Inscriptions, we are building the “Orescriptions” protocol to bring NFTs to the Iron Fish network and further expand this privacy ecosystem.

Orya aims to be the first and easiest-to-use NFT launchpad for the Orescriptions protocol in the Iron Fish ecosystem."

##### **How did you get started? Who’s in the team behind Orya?**

"Orya all started from a short discussion with Elena, Iron Fish’s CEO. We all agreed that NFTs, just like any other kind of asset or token, can benefit from privacy as well. Since then, Orya has been a community based project. Right now, the Orya founder is the core author, but the plan is to open source the code base to the community and grow together."

##### **Why did you decide to apply for a grant from Iron Fish?**

"I’m a community developer, and I’ve spent a lot of time and energy on infrastructure costs while building Oreoscan. However, frontend work isn’t my strong suit, so I applied for a grant to receive the resources I needed to build out the entire vision for Orya."

##### **What do you plan to do with the Iron Fish grant in order to continue growing Orya?**

"Orya is currently in development! We received a grant for a total of $20,000 USD from the Iron Fish Foundation, which will be used to get a high performance server and a frontend developer to join the project."

##### **What other resources have you received from the Iron Fish team or community?**

"We received a very positive response from the Iron Fish team and Elena. We are about to launch the Orescriptions protocol on the Iron Fish testnet, and hope we can grow together with this community."

##### **What’s the roadmap for Orya?**

"This grant was awarded to three projects: Oreoscan, the Orescriptions platform, and the Orya launchpad. Oreoscan is already live, so the roadmap for the remaining two is as follows:

1. Orescriptions platform launch on testnet, likely the week of August 22nd.
2. Orescriptions platform launch on mainnet, likely in early September.
3. Orya is expected to launch on testnet early September.
4. Enable Orya to connect to the Iron Fish wallet from the website.
5. Orya launches on Iron Fish mainnet.
6. Orya launches its first NFT collection with the Iron Fish Foundation."

##### **Thank you, Orya!**

We’d like to recognize the Orya founder who has been a longtime contributor since Iron Fish’s early testnet phase. Some of their contributions include:

1. [Oreos nodejs rpc provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oreos): An ironfish provider implementation and utilities in TypeScript.

2. [Awesome-ironfish](https://github.com/oreoslabs/awesome-ironfish): A github repo for main Iron Fish ecosystem resources.

3. [Oreoscan explorer](https://www.oreoscan.info/en): A top private Iron Fish block explorer available since testnet.

4. [Wallet tools](https://github.com/hairtail/oreos-rust) (deprecated): An address solution for miners during early days of mainnet.

5. Many bug reports, PRs, and features proposed to enrich the Iron Fish ecosystem.

Orya is going live soon, so stay tuned for more updates on its development in the Iron Fish community!
