Oreoscan is a community driven blockchain explorer for Iron Fish. The project was developed during the incentivized testnet phase of Iron Fish to address the community's need for a reliable block explorer for Iron Fish.

Users can utilize Oreoscan’s intuitive UI to explore important Iron Fish network metrics, block and transaction feeds, or take a look at network computing power and transaction fee variation charts.
Oreoscan + Iron Fish
Oreoscan and Iron Fish share a focus on privacy and security. The Oreoscan team had the goal of building a secure and private blockchain explorer and found that Iron Fish’s implementation of zk-SNARK technology delivered maximum security. The network’s fast-growing community of miners and nodes also contributes to the overall reliability of Oreoscan’s block explorer.

“Iron Fish has facilitated the implementation of crucial features such as encryption of transaction data, read-only view keys for users, and the ability to securely share account information. These features are instrumental in maintaining the privacy and security of user transactions while still enabling compliance and proof of transaction when necessary.” — Fishguy, creator of Oreoscan.

Additionally, Iron Fish's approach to accessibility made it an ideal choice for creating an easy-to-use platform like Oreoscan.

Says Fishguy, “We chose to use Iron Fish for our project due to its strong emphasis on privacy and security. Iron Fish's implementation of zk-SNARK technology ensures maximum security across the platform, aligning with our goal of providing a secure and private blockchain explorer. Additionally, Iron Fish's user-friendly approach and commitment to accessibility make it an ideal choice for creating an easy-to-use platform like Oreoscan.”
Community Response
During its integration process, Oreoscan received an overwhelmingly positive response from the Iron Fish community, including development teams and partners. 

Users appreciated the enhanced privacy features on Oreoscan as well as the intuitive user interface and seamless integration with the network. At the same time, they shared valuable feedback that helped the team refine the platform and prioritize certain features. 

Of their work with the Iron Fish team, Fishguy shares: “The Iron Fish team has been incredibly supportive throughout the integration process of Oreoscan. They provided us with technical documentation, guidance, and access to their development resources. We had regular communication and collaboration sessions with the Iron Fish team, where we discussed implementation details, best practices, and addressed any challenges that arose. Their expertise and responsiveness played a crucial role in ensuring a smooth integration of Oreoscan with the Iron Fish network. We are grateful for their support and collaboration during this process.” 
Looking Forward
Oreoscan is still in the early stages of its roadmap and there’s a lot more to come. After a successful launch of the initial version of its blockchain explorer, the team is working on:

Expanding its feature set 
Collaborating with other projects that enhance security disclosures
Facilitating address-based communication between users


In the near future, Oreoscan will expand its functionality by incorporating advanced analytics and data visualization tools. This will provide users with deeper insights into the Iron Fish network and enhance their overall exploration experience.
