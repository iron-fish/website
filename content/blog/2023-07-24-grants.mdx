Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of the [Iron Fish Grants Program](https://ironfish.network/community/grants)!

Through privacy, we want to make web3 safe in an increasingly digital and connected world. Our mission is to bring privacy to crypto by expanding Iron Fish to be the chain-agnostic privacy platform for all crypto assets. The Iron Fish Grants Program will fund builders and creators to help them make privacy an innate characteristic of blockchain transactions. We will also fund research in the space.

### Who can apply?

We welcome anyone who has a vision for Iron Fish and its ecosystem to apply!

Priority will be given to:

- Projects that bridge Iron Fish with other chains or L2 tech stacks
- Exploration of incentive mechanisms for bridging and cross-chain privacy enhanced DEX designs
- Performance optimizations for the Iron Fish protocol
- Educational initiatives about Iron Fish

### Application and Review Process

To apply, please visit the [Grants Page](https://ironfish.network/community/grants). 

For applications that meet requirements, the Iron Fish Foundation will review and revert back within 1 week to the applicant. Approved projects will receive milestone-based funding, technical guidance, and community spotlights.

### Expectations

We strongly believe that working in the open and getting feedback early leads to better products. If applicable we will ask you to open-source your project, and lead discussions about your work on Discourse, Discord, or through the FIP process. 

### Thank you   

The Iron Fish community is only just beginning, but with your help we can make Iron Fish the privacy platform for all of crypto. Thank you for helping us make Iron Fish better — we can’t wait to see what you will build!
