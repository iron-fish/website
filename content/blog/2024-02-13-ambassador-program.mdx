## Hello everyone! 

We’re exited to announce that today we’ll be launching our 12 week Ambassador Program for Iron Fish. Anyone — yes you — can participate and be eligible for a prize.  

Iron Fish has been mainnet launched since April 20th, 2023 to bring safe privacy to crypto. The goal for this Ambassador Program is to help spread the word about Iron Fish and the importance of private crypto transactions as well as to welcome more community members ❤️

### How to Participate

The Ambassador Program will run for 12 weeks with 12 *separate* prize pools and 12 separate sets of winners. 

Each week will have have a prize pool for $1,000 USDC for US residents and 1,000 IRON for non-US residents. For each prize pool 10 winners will be chosen. 

The program will be managed via [Zealy](https://zealy.io/c/ironfish/questboard). Categories for how to participate are subject to change week by week and include flash quests. Each week will have a brand new leaderboard with a new set of participants.
