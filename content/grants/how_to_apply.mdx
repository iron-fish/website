## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

At the Iron Fish Foundation we deeply value the expansion of the Iron Fish ecosystem. If you are an innovator, builder, or researcher passionate about the intersection of financial privacy and cryptocurrency, we invite you to apply for a grant. 

We are particularly interested in projects that enhance user experience with Iron Fish, increase interoperability with other chains, or otherwise expand the use-cases of Iron Fish.

We offer grants for projects that directly impact the Iron Fish ecosystem in a positive way. If you are a builder passionate about privacy in crypto, we invite you to apply. Do you have an idea that'll expand the Iron Fish ecosystem, enhance user experience or increase interoperability for Iron Fish? Fantastic! Read below!
