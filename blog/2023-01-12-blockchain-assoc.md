[Iron Fish](https://ironfish.network/) is excited to announce membership in the [Blockchain Association](https://theblockchainassociation.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to giving cryptocurrency a voice in the United States government. As a new privacy coin and platform, Iron Fish focuses on building community and increasing digital currency access.

"Blockchain Association is proud to welcome Iron Fish as its newest member," said Kristin Smith, CEO of Blockchain Association. “Privacy is a human right. Iron Fish is enabling everyday users of web3 networks to exercise that right by building out compliant, privacy-focused base-layer technology.”

Iron Fish believes privacy and compliance do not have to be at odds, and will leverage membership in the Blockchain Association to raise up the cryptocurrency community’s needs and concerns. The future of decentralized currency is full of opportunity for those left behind by traditional financial institutions.

>The Blockchain Association is a leading advocate for responsible actors in the crypto space.  We are honored to join them in their efforts to highlight the good actors in the space and bring about regulatory clarity to allow these good actors to flourish and keep innovation here in the United States. -***Craig Timm, General Counsel at Iron Fish***

Iron Fish was founded in 2019 and will launch [Testnet Phase 3](https://testnet.ironfish.network/about) on January 18, 2023.
