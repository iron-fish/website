We launched [Phase 3 of our incentivized testnet](https://www.ironfish.network/blog/2023/01/18/phase3) on January 18th — debuting our multi-asset support. We are so impressed by how our community showed up. Phase 3 is the final step in our testnet. 🏃‍♀️🐟

Phase 3 wraps up on **March 7th**, giving our team time to work on our Mainnet launch later that month.

Here are just a few updates from the first few weeks of Phase 3:

💻 The Iron Fish network is reporting **over 25k** nodes (see more stats [here](https://stats.ironfish.network/?orgId=1))

🔨 Users have minted **over 150k** assets (check out our [community-created explorer](http://www.oreoscan.info/en/assets))

🌏 People from **over 200** countries have signed up

🤝 Our Discord server is closing in on **35k** users
