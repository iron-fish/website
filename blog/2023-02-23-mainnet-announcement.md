Hello Iron Fish community! As we lead up to mainnet launch and share updates, we'd like first to recognize all of you. Your support has been motivating, and your feedback has made Iron Fish better.

🙌THANK YOU!🙌

And now, the announcements that you've been waiting for:

-   So that we can focus on mainnet launch and more fairly distribute tokens via our airdrop, we're ending Phase 3 on Feb 24th at 12PST.
-   The Iron Fish mainnet will launch on March 14!!

Here are answers to questions we anticipate and some updates:

### What will you be able to do on 3.14?

All our current capabilities will be live on the mainnet:

-   mining
-   minting
-   burning
-   host a node
-   transactions

### How is Iron Fish celebrating?

March 14 is [Pi day](https://www.piday.org/)! We’ll be hosting a YouTube Live event (more on that soon). We’ll eat some pie, answer some questions from users, and maybe have some sparklers.

We hope you’ll be there to celebrate with us! If you plan to hold your own Iron Fish event, let us know on Discord in the #outreach channel.

### Why is Phase 3 ending early?

Phase 3 has been a tremendous success, and there have been very few bugs reported with regard to Multi-Asset.

Alongside the incredible participation of organic Iron Fish users, however, we've noted behavior that suggests that there are a few users manipulating the API to get a large portion of the rewards for themselves.

This behavior is clogging the API, making it hard for normal users to accrue points and diluting rewards that will be distributed to organic users. Ending Phase 3 early protects honest Iron Fish users and lets us focus on our preparation for mainnet.

### 🚀Phase 3 Update

Phase 3 has been, to put it mildly, an incredible success. The stats speak for themselves:

-   We have over 38k users in Discord
-   Users have minted [over 200k assets](http://www.oreoscan.info/en/assets).
-   The network has hosted almost 40k concurrent nodes, check out our stats [here](https://stats.ironfish.network/?orgId=1).

### 💪Trusted Ceremony Update

We opened our trusted setup to our community on February 13th, and it will run through March 3rd. So far, we have over 1500 participants.

We hosted a [YouTube live event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZNuWFB_xbg) with crypto community leaders, so users could hang out with us as they began participating 🎙️

### 🙌Community Update

Here are some amazing stats:

-   You live in over 200 different countries
-   You speak over 20 different languages
-   You’ve sent over 300k messages in Discord
-   46 users have made 150 commits

Here are just a few of the community contributions we've highlighted:
