Last week was a big one for a company like ours that prefers building in silence. We were recognized by The Information as a [Top 50 Most Promising Startup](https://www.theinformation.com/ti50). Two days later, our Series A investor Sequoia Capital published a [profile](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/elena-nadolinski-spotlight/) on our founder & CEO Elena.

## Top 50 Most Promising Startup

As CEO Jessica Lessin mentioned in [announcing](https://twitter.com/Jessicalessin/status/1584938280050515968) The Information’s Top 50 Most Promising Startups, their list wasn’t based on “buzz” or “paid placements,” but reporting. 

And The Information’s reporting is second to none. They boast the largest newsroom of tech reporters producing original journalism in the world. Their world-class brand attracts hundreds of thousands of active readers and tens of thousands of subscribers, including the world’s most prominent business leaders. Based on that readership, it’s no surprise that The Information is considered the most influential tech publication in the world.

Not only were we thrilled to be recognized, we were honored to be a part of an impressive crypto cohort: dYdX, Nansen, Elementus, Render, and thirdweb. Collectively, The Information rated our companies as “best positioned to make it through the winter.” In addition to Iron Fish, The Information highlighted two of our Series A investors, a16z and Sequoia, for backing so many of the Top 50. Speaking of Sequoia… 

## Sequoia Capital Spotlight

“We help the daring build legendary companies, from idea to IPO and beyond.”

When Don Valentine started Sequoia Capital in 1972, semiconductor companies reigned supreme in the Bay Area. So much so that its core ingredient received top billing in the eponymously named Silicon Valley. Sequoia’s first $3m fund invested in small startups like Apple and Atari. In the 50 years since, Sequoia’s track record of spotting and supporting small daring teams become legendary companies is unmatched. Google, Oracle, Cisco, Nvidia, Paypal, Airbnb, Instagram, WhatsApp, Stripe, Figma, and FTX are just a few of the companies that Sequoia has backed over half a century. 

With such a singularly impactful stable of technology companies, it was even more impressive that they asked to [spotlight](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/elena-nadolinski-spotlight/) the work of Iron Fish and our CEO and founder Elena Nadolinski. In our unbiased opinion, the profile has it all: Elena’s early promise as a technologist, her 2017 crypto and NFT rabbit holes, why Iron Fish’s innovation is so urgent, and even a (privacy-centric, of course) love story. As Sequoia partner and Iron Fish investor Shaun Maguire [teased](https://twitter.com/shaunmmaguire/status/1585693948806590464), Elena’s “journey into crypto doesn’t disappoint!”

We’ll leave you with our team’s favorite line, considering the 50-year firm that got its start backing a pair of young Steves: “The Iron Fish core team has a mantra to make Iron Fish ‘the Apple of blockchains’—intuitive, easy to use and something that works right out of the box.”

Thank you to The Information and Sequoia Capital for recognizing the hard work of the entire Iron Fish community. It’s still early–both in crypto and at Iron Fish. We are always looking for more people to ensure consumers are even safer on-chain than they are online. We’d love to have you join our mission.
