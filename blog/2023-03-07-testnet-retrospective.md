# Incentivised Testnet Launch

The first phase of our testnet launched in early 2021.

At that point, Iron Fish already had an organically growing community.

Things moved incredibly quickly, and we're grateful for the support that we enjoyed from both our community and fellow builders in the space.

## Testnet Phase 1

In November 2021, Iron Fish secured [Series A funding](https://ironfish.network/blog/2021/11/30/series-a-incentivized-testnet) that supported rapid growth and the launch of the Incentivized Testnet Phase (December 1, 2021‚ÄìMarch 11, 2022).

Highlights include:

-   Our user base grew to include people from 156 countries!
-   18,000 community members joined our Discord.
-   Over 9,000 participants earned points on the leaderboard by contributing in some way to the network.
-   Over ~3000 nodes registered online via opt-in telemetry.
-   ~300 GitHub bug reports closed.
    
Check out a few of our Phase 1 [highlighted community contributions](https://twitter.com/ironfishcrypto/status/1516115934632714245).

This testnet phase surpassed all expectations, and as the community grew, we grew as a project and worked to define a culture that aligns with our goal to bring encrypted blockchain transactions to all of web3.

We celebrated milestones privately and publicly and, as always, drew energy and inspiration from our interactions with the community.
