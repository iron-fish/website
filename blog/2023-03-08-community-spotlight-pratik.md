Iron Fish community members are always willing to step up and support each other, as our ongoing Community Spotlight series shows. In this post, we feature [Discord](https://discord.ironfish.network) member pratikmb#1122. Pratik has been relentless in his efforts to help users through Phase 3 and as we transition to mainnet.

### Tell us about yourself.

*My name is Pratik Garg, and I am a web3 enthusiast from India. I am deeply passionate about the potential of blockchain technology and decentralized systems to transform how we interact with the digital world. To pursue my passion, I recently boldly decided to leave my job as a Data Engineer with PwC to immerse myself in web3. With over 10 years of IT experience, my skills and expertise will be valuable assets in the rapidly growing web3 ecosystem. I am determined to contribute meaningfully to support the development and adoption of this exciting new technology.*

### How did you get into crypto?

*In 2017, there was a lot of excitement around Bitcoin, and I jumped on the bandwagon and purchased some when the price peaked at $15,000. At the time, I was caught up in the hype and believed the price would continue to skyrocket, potentially reaching $100,000 or more.*

*However, as we all know, the crypto market can be incredibly volatile, and after just a few months, the price of Bitcoin began to decline rapidly. Unfortunately, I was caught up in the downturn and experienced significant losses. It was a harsh but valuable lesson, and I now better understand the risks and rewards associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.*

### What do you think will drive crypto adoption?


-   *Increased awareness and education: As more people become aware of cryptocurrencies and how they work, they may be more likely to consider using them.*
    
-   *Advancements in blockchain technology: As blockchain technology continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, it will make cryptocurrencies more secure and easier to use, which will drive adoption.*
    
-   *Integration with traditional financial systems: If cryptocurrencies become more integrated with traditional financial systems, it would make it easier for people to use them for everyday transactions.*
    
-   *Globalization and the need for cross-border transactions: As more people conduct business and engage in cross-border transactions, cryptocurrencies could become a more convenient and efficient way to transfer funds.*
    
-   *Regulatory clarity: If governments provide clear regulations around the use and ownership of cryptocurrencies, it would give people more confidence in crypto and encourage adoption.*
    
-   *Privacy: As people become more concerned about online privacy and the security of their personal information, cryptocurrencies that offer greater privacy and anonymity could become more popular.*

### Do you use dApps? If so, which ones?

*Some of the dApps I use include:*
-   *Uniswap/Hashflow: A decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading cryptocurrencies.*
    
-   *Aave: A decentralized lending and borrowing platform.*
    
-   *Opensea: A marketplace for buying, selling, and discovering rare digital items and collectibles, including NFTs.*
    
-   *Gitcoin: A platform that enables users to earn cryptocurrency for contributing to open-source software projects.*

### When did you learn about Iron Fish, and what sparked your interest?

*I was disappointed to discover Ironfish only at the start of phase 3, but I still am an early adopter. After reading the documentation, blogs, and whitepaper, I was fascinated by the role of private transactions using zk-SNARKs in real-life DeFi applications. Ironfish's commitment to security through PoW was a primary factor that sparked my interest.*

### Why is crypto privacy important to you?

*If User A makes a transaction with cryptocurrency at a retail store and the transaction is recorded on a public blockchain without any privacy protections, User B or any other party may be able to access User A's entire transaction history. This could reveal sensitive information about User A's financial situation, including how much they have spent, where they have spent it, and with whom they have transacted.*

*By providing privacy features such as pseudonymity and encryption, cryptocurrencies can help protect the privacy and security of users. These features can ensure that transaction information is only visible to the parties involved while maintaining the blockchain network's transparency and security.*

###  What has been your experience with the Iron Fish community?
*I was blown away by the activity level in the Ironfish community during the testnet phase. Seeing members' enthusiasm to set up a node and contribute to the project's privacy goals was terrific! The community was incredibly live and active 24/7, with dedicated individuals providing support around the clock.*

###  What do you think draws others to Iron Fish?

*Several factors may draw individuals or organizations to the Iron Fish blockchain protocol:*

*Privacy: Iron Fish is designed to provide users with a high degree of privacy, using advanced cryptographic techniques to protect their transactions and personal data. This is particularly important for individuals and companies that value confidentiality and security.*

*Decentralization: Iron Fish is a decentralized network, meaning no central authority controls the system. This can be attractive to those who value the benefits of decentralization, such as increased transparency, security, and control.*

*Flexibility: Iron Fish is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing developers to create a wide range of applications and use cases on top of the protocol. This can be appealing to businesses and entrepreneurs seeking to develop new solutions in the blockchain space.*

*Overall, the combination of privacy, decentralization, and flexibility make Iron Fish an attractive option for individuals and organizations looking to build on a robust blockchain platform.*

###  What has your experience been like interacting with Iron Fish team members?

*They are committed to building a secure, decentralized network that empowers users to transact with privacy and freedom. Most importantly, the Iron Fish team is dedicated, knowledgeable, and passionate. Reaching out to them is also very easy ‚Äì they are just a Discord message away.*

### What makes Iron Fish different from other crypto projects?

*Elena acknowledges that any project focused on privacy deserves deep respect. While healthy competition is essential, she believes that, ultimately, these projects are allies working towards a common goal of advancing privacy. By pushing each other to innovate and improve, they can collectively create a more private and secure digital environment for everyone.*

*Iron Fish is focused on building and creating.*

### Is there anything else that you‚Äôd like to share?

*I look forward to the release of Iron Fish's mainnet and am excited to see how the project will promote privacy in the web3 space. Witnessing the next level of privacy in this emerging field is something I am eagerly anticipating, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this innovative technology.*

*All the very best, team!!!*
