Do you know that feeling you get when you pick up your mobile phone and scroll all the way back to the beginning of your photo album? That about sums up what it's like for us when we go through all your submissions to the #memes and #art-and-multimedia channels on [Discord](https://discord.ironfish.network/).

[note all images are from our Discord – where Twitter links available, we've added them here]

In meme, art, and multimedia contests –  and beyond – the Iron Fish community has long been a creative force. The countless videos, images, and artwork that you've made are for us a record of our journey to mainnet. If we could, we'd include all of them here. But that would make for a long article… and we've got to get ready for March 14th!
