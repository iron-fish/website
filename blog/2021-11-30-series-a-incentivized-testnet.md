## Iron Fish Incentivized Testnet launching December 1st

Since we launched the very first Iron Fish testnet we‚Äôve had nearly 2k self-identified miners. Iron Fish community members all around the world have given us feedback, contributed code, translated installation instructions to a different language, wrote scripts for how to install Iron Fish even faster, made YouTube videos on how to install Iron Fish on hosting providers, and much more.

On December 1st we‚Äôre launching the Iron Fish Incentivized Testnet to reward our awesome community members (and new ones!) for their continued support as we move towards our mainnet launch. The incentivized testnet will track member participation going forward in leaderboard points that can be earned through various categories. Points will lead to future mainnet Iron Fish coins for eligible participants. The testnet will allow us to give back to the community and create many more future Iron Fish coin holders around the world.

## Universal Privacy Layer‚ÄîRoadmap for Iron Fish

At Iron Fish <a href="https://ironfish.network/faq/">we have one goal</a>: enable private cryptocurrency transactions. We believe the future of money is digital, decentralized, and censorship-resistant‚Äîa future that cannot exist without privacy features to protect its users. Our brand new layer-1 blockchain uses zero-knowledge proofs to provide the strongest privacy guarantees available on every transaction. Soon, we‚Äôll enable multi-assets and bridge Iron Fish to other chains, letting users transfer assets from other blockchains to Iron Fish for fully private transactions on _any asset_. We‚Äôre building Iron Fish to be the universal privacy layer for crypto‚Äîa true SSL layer for blockchains.
