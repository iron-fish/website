Hi, Iron Fish fam! We have some community updates we‚Äôre excited about. Check them out below   

## Ambassador Program Wrap-Up

We‚Äôve just wound down our 6-month [Ambassador Program](https://www.ironfish.network/blog/2022/05/03/ambassador-program). We were extremely pleased by the enthusiasm that the program generated, but most of all, we were delighted to engage with the captains and voyagers who took part. All participants who responded on Discord have now received a special, limited edition **Iron Fish NFT** as a thank you. 

This initial round of the Ambassador Program gave us many ideas on how to continue with new and even better community programs going forward. Here is just some of the feedback that we received. 

*I enjoy helping newcomers and helping promote Iron Fish! The community is active, and understands how blockchain mining works ‚Äì it‚Äôs a friendly and polite group as well!‚Äù*
***-Palamar, Iron Fish Community Captain***

*I joined the ambassador program because I like how things are done at Iron Fish. I like the team, I like the community, and I‚Äôm glad to be a part of it. My goal is to help people, and I was able to help others solve their problems in the testnet phase.* 
***-null, Iron Fish Community Voyager***

*If we believe in web3, then we need to support projects like Iron Fish that protect privacy. 99% of crypto users are well-meaning people, but there‚Äôs a small segment that wishes to do harm, so it‚Äôs important to be able to maintain wallet confidentiality and protect our identities. I‚Äôve been here since the beginning and love being an ambassador!*
***-El Turco, Iron Fish Community Voyager***

Stay tuned for more opportunities to get involved!

 ## Marketing Team Growth

We have an open and incredible user base; to help support the community and maintain regular communications with you, we‚Äôve brought on two team members to help out ‚Äì **Meg Blanchette** as Director of Marketing and **Neil Doshi** as Content Marketing Manager. 

Meg has been in the tech space for over a decade, starting as an editor for O‚ÄôReilly Media before moving to MarComm roles at AI and edtech startups. Neil comes to us having worked for two years in the crypto industry with prominent Layer-1s and crypto investment platforms, where he focused on content and user education. Prior to taking the plunge into crypto, DeFi, and web3, Neil worked in academia.

Both Meg and Neil will participate in our next monthly Discord pulse call on **December 9**, so be sure to [stop by](https://discord.com/invite/EkQkEcm8DH) and say hello! 

Whether it‚Äôs the Holiday Season or the World Cup(!), we‚Äôre heading into that time of year when different parts of the world slow down a little. But at the Iron Fish HQ, we‚Äôre getting ready to ramp up our efforts to engage our amazing users. Importantly, we‚Äôll also soon share more information on how users can participate in **Testnet Phase 3**.
