## Docker

Run the Docker image from the GitHub registry, mounting the node's data directory into your home directory and using the host network. (Replace `<home-directory>` with `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows or `$HOME` on others)

```sh
docker run --rm --tty --interactive --network host --volume <home-directory>/.ironfish:/root/.ironfish ghcr.io/iron-fish/ironfish:latest
```

Now check the status of your node using IPC, again replacing `<home-directory>` according to your OS.

```sh
docker run --rm --tty --interactive --network host --volume <home-directory>/.ironfish:/root/.ironfish ghcr.io/iron-fish/ironfish:latest status -f
```

**Note:** `--network host` is needed for 2 Docker containers to connect over IPC.

**Note:** You can also use the RPC layer over TCP by starting your node with `--rpc.tcp`, which connects over the default port 8020.

### Updating

To update your image, use `docker pull` before running the image.

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/iron-fish/ironfish:latest
```

## Install from source

First, head over to GitHub to clone our [official repository](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish). Once that's done, follow the initial setup steps in the [README](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish#initial-setup) to install prerequisites, then head to the [CLI README](https://github.com/iron-fish/ironfish/tree/master/ironfish-cli#use-scenarios) to run the CLI.

## Install via Homebrew

> **Note:** Our Homebrew tap does not yet support **Apple Silicon/arm64**. We recommend installing Iron Fish [using NPM](/use/get-started/installation#install-or-update-iron-fish-win-mac). You can also install Iron Fish [from the source](#from-source) or [use Docker](#using-docker) with `x86_64` support.

Start by adding our Homebrew tap and installing Iron Fish.

```sh
brew tap iron-fish/brew && brew install ironfish
```

You're all set! Run the Iron Fish CLI:

```sh
ironfish
```

When updates are available, update Brew, then reinstall Iron Fish.

```sh
brew update && brew uninstall ironfish && brew install ironfish
```
