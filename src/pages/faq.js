      __html: `Many popular cryptocurrencies are permanent ledgers that broadcast all the details of a transaction—similar to tweeting out your bank statement. Yet privacy is a requirement for a true global currency. Participating in the network of other coins is cumbersome both to the end user and the miner.
      <br/><br/>
      Our combination of privacy and accessibility means that anyone, anywhere, can have access to private, decentralized money.

    description: {
      __html: `Right now, digital payments are fundamentally lacking in privacy — they are surveilled, analyzed, collected, and sold. With every online purchase, your metadata for that transaction is stored (from what IP you used, to your physical location, to your purchase history, and more).
      <br/><br/>
    Privacy leads to innovation and social evolution. Much like HTTPS paved the way for entire industries through online e-commerce, we believe private transactions over a blockchain will enable frictionless global payments and new industries of borderless products and companies. Historically, this type of financial privacy has only been available to the rich, via offshore accounts. With Iron Fish, anyone can have an even better alternative to a Swiss bank account on their phone.`,

    description: {
      __html: `We are working with cutting-edge cryptography using zero-knowledge. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are a breakthrough tool in cryptography that prove honest computation. By using ZKPs we can build private transactions that fully hide the sender, the recipient and the amount, while providing a proof that the transaction is valid. Every transaction on Iron Fish is private—no one sees the details of an account unless the owner grants read-only permissions via view keys.
      <br/><br/>
    This level of privacy is unprecedented when compared to other cryptocurrencies or traditional banking plans.`,

    description: {
      __html: `Most cryptocurrencies are made by engineers, for engineers, which results in a high barrier to entry. There are over 4 billion internet users, on over 2 billion computers across the world. And yet, there are only around 10,000 fully active-listening Bitcoin nodes. If we want truly decentralized money, we need to make it easier to use and participate in the network.`,

    description: {
      __html: `We’ve done thorough and extensive research on the merits and drawbacks of PoW, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake systems. Ultimately, PoW systems are overall more secure, have much better understood attack vectors, and have a better path towards being fairly decentralized. PoS systems can sometimes lead to better UI/UX and faster block times, but the pros do not outweigh the cons when looking at their algorithms holistically.`,
