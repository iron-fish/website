**Your node doesn't have to be running at the same time as the sender to send or receive a transaction.**

## Send a transaction

#### Interactive mode

Send a transaction by running the following command using your default account:
```sh
ironfish wallet:send
```

<Terminal command={Send} />
<br />
If you want to send a transaction from a different account, you can use the `-f` flag.

E.g.
```sh
ironfish wallet:send -f MyOtherAccount
```

#### Noninteractive mode

Run `ironfish wallet:send --help` to see the different options available.

E.g. To send 2 coins from the account `Savings`
```sh
ironfish wallet:send -a 2 -o 0.00000001 -t 997c...7fc52ed -f Savings
```

## Receive a transaction
To receive a transaction, you just need to communicate the public key of your account to the sender. If you don't know your public key, run the following command:
```sh
ironfish wallet:address
```

E.g. To get the public key of a different account on your node
```sh
ironfish wallet:address Savings
```

## Balance

You can check your balance at any time by running the following command:
```sh
ironfish wallet:balance
```

## Next steps

You can now track your transaction on the network, or [start mining $IRON](mine.md).
