## Data structure
By default, the database and configuration files for the Iron Fish node are created in the `~./ironfish` directory.

The file structure is composed of the following:
```
[Iron Fish Node]
├── accounts
...└── default
├── config.json
├── internal.json
└── databases
...└── default
```

Configuration files can be edited by the commands described [here](cli.md#config).
Accounts can be edited by the commands described [here](cli.md#account--wallet)

You can change the working directory by passing the flag `--datadir` when running a command. Doing so will require you to sync the node again with the network.
