## Iron Fish Faucet

You can receive free $IRON to start testing Iron Fish. You can keep these coins, or send them to friends.

To get these coins, you can run the following command:
```sh
ironfish faucet
```

<Terminal command={Faucet} />
<br />

Once the request is executed, our Faucet will send a transaction to your account. Depending on the volume of requests, it might take several minutes before the coins reaches your account. You can check your balance with the following command:
```sh
ironfish accounts:balance
```

## Next steps

Now that you have coins on your account, you can start sending transactions.
