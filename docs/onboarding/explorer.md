Once a transaction is executed, a confirmation message with the transaction hash is displayed on the CLI.

E.g.

```sh
Transaction Hash: e032e78268a1097288503e18510e48d140292ff5ce91d0914ae00f733ad8d166
```

You can use the [Iron Fish Block Explorer](https://explorer.ironfish.network/) to display information about this transaction. Of course, because Iron Fish is a fully private cryptocurrency, a limit amount of information are actually available to the public.
