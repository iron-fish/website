This initial iteration of Iron Fish sets up the groundwork for private transactions that anyone can reliably use, with a low barrier of entry. We are proud of what weâ€™ve built, and look forward to the next iterations, which will include, among other things:

- Custom assets
- Functionalities to support stable coins and layer 2s
- Richer web and mobile support

We are on a mission to enable the free flow of value, while believing everyone has a right to privacy. If you want to learn more, or are interested in joining us, <a href="mailto:contact@ironfish.network">get in touch</a>.
